<small>A NEW FRIEND MADE.</small></h2>


<p>“Are either Mr. Chadwick or Mr. Jesson
about?”</p>

<p>“Humph!” and the gangling, rather disagreeable-looking
youth who had answered the summons
to the door of the Boy Inventors’ workshop,
gave a supercilious look over the dusty and
worn, although carefully mended, clothes of the
dark-eyed, dark-haired, slender youth who confronted
him.</p>

<p>“What do you want to know that for, anyhow?”
and upon the personal pronoun he placed
a contemptuous emphasis.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>
<p>“That is a question to which I can only reply
when I can see either Jack Chadwick or Tom
Jesson personally. My name is Ned Nevins,&mdash;not
that either of them knows me,&mdash;but will you
be so kind as to find out if they’ll see me?”</p>

<p>“If you can’t tell me your business, you can’t
see them. State what you want to me. If it’s
money&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is not!”</p>

<p>The dark-eyed young visitor’s eyes held a
warning flash which the other lad, who was half
a head taller and far stouter of build than Ned
Nevins, affected not to notice.</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t speak to them.” This with
an air of finality.</p>

<p>“But you don’t understand&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I do, perfectly. They are both far too busy
to bother with any inquisitive kind of tramp that
happens along.”</p>

<p>“Then you won’t let them know I would like
to see them?”</p>

<p>The other’s voice rose angrily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>“I said ‘No’ once. N-O-<em>no</em>! Isn’t that
enough?”</p>

<p>“Quite enough.”</p>

<p>Ned Nevins turned away. As he did so, the
other lad, an employee of the Boy Inventors, and
a former school chum, noticed that he had under
his arm a box which he appeared to handle with
unusual care. But Sam Hinkley noted also Ned’s
dejected and downcast air. He decided to humiliate
him still further.</p>

<p>“Get a move on&mdash;you. Skip!”</p>

<p>Ned hastened his pace. He felt too disappointed
and tired to retort to the bully as he
should have done. Sam Hinkley interpreted this
as cowardice on Ned’s part, and being a natural
bully he decided to improve the occasion according
to his own delight. He came up behind Ned
and gave the slightly-built lad a strong shove.</p>

<p>Ned faced ’round, and his pale face flushed an
angry crimson.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>
<p>“Don’t do that again, please!”</p>

<p>Young Hinkley’s rejoinder was to make a rush
at him. He extended both his hands to shove
the visitor, whom he had found so unwelcome, off
the premises. But the next instant he met with a
setback. Still holding his precious box under
one arm, Ned’s fingers closed on the bully’s
wrists. They shut down with a grip like steel
handcuffs.</p>

<p>“Ow! Ouch! Leggo my hands,” roared Sam
at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>“From what I’ve heard of Jack Chadwick and
Tom Jesson I don’t believe they would tolerate
for an instant the way you have behaved toward
me,” was the firm reply. “March!”</p>

<p>“Where are we going?” inquired Sam, writhing
painfully under the young stranger’s powerful
grip, unable to do anything, try as he would to
shake it off.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<p>“Straight into that workshop. From what I
can hear, I believe we will find those whom I wish
to see inside.”</p>

<p>Sam looked very uncomfortable. He was the
son of fairly well-to-do parents in the little town
of Nestorville, on the outskirts of which Mr.
Chadwick’s home was situated. Jack and Tom
had taken him on because he was a youth who
had always shown mechanical ability and had
pleaded persistently for a chance to work in the
big experimental shop at High Towers.</p>

<p>But a fair trial of Sam Hinkley had not resulted
in his rising in favor with his young employers.
He had been detected in several mean
acts. Besides, they felt he was hardly a lad to
be trusted with the important secrets of the workshop,
in which most of the inventions of the boys
and their father and uncle were worked out. So
that had Sam but known it, he was by no means
so important a factor at High Towers as he
imagined.</p>

<p>“Lemmo go and I’ll take you in,” howled Sam.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<p>“Very well. You might have done so in the
first place.”</p>

<p>But no sooner were Sam’s hands released than
he aimed a savage blow at young Nevins.</p>

<p>“I’ll trim you for this, you&mdash;you scarecrow,
you!” he bawled out. “I’ll fix you. I’ll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Here, here! What’s all the trouble about?”</p>

<p>The question was asked by a tall, well-built
youth with curly dark hair and sparkling, intelligent
eyes, who had just appeared at the door of
the workshop.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I wanted to find Mr. Chadwick, Jr.,” began
the newcomer, while Sam looked abashed.</p>

<p>“Sure you weren’t looking for trouble?” asked
Jack, but a twinkle in his eyes belied the implied
reproach in the question. He knew Sam Hinkley
from the soles of his shoes up. Besides, he had
witnessed the last part of the recent scene and
realized how the land lay.</p>

<p>“Go back on your job,” he ordered Sam
brusquely, “those bolts must be ready by noon at
the latest.”</p>

<p>“Bu-bu-but&mdash;&mdash;” began Sam, and then, read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>ing
what he saw in Jack’s eye aright, he obeyed,
but not without a backward glance at Ned Nevins.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why, you are Jack&mdash;I mean Mister&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” was the smiling response,
“I am Jack Chadwick. What did you wish to see
me about?”</p>

<p>“Principally about getting a job. I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid there’s nothing here for you,” was
the reply, as Jack glanced with interest at the intelligent
face that gazed so eagerly into his own,
and then, as he saw the travel-stained lad’s countenance
fall he added, “You see this is an experimental
shop mainly, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know. I’ve heard all about your inventions,
the Sky-ship and the diving Torpedo Boat and
so on. I love mechanics and I’m sure I could
make good if you’d give me a chance.”</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Nevins is my name, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ever had any experience along such lines?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, my uncle was an inventor. He was
poor and worked in a machine-shop, but when
he was at home he and I used to spend all our
time in a workshop he had fitted up. You see
my folks died a long time ago and I was brought
up in my uncle’s home. He said that some day
I’d be famous if I worked hard and that I had a
natural ability for mechanics and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Ned Nevins stopped short, flushed over what
he felt had been a conceited speech. But Jack
glanced at him encouragingly. The young inventor
was quick to read character. He began to
take an interest in this ragged visitor, who had
dropped down out of the skies, so to speak.</p>

<p>“But you are not living with your uncle now,
Nevins?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. He was killed a month or more ago
in an accident in the mills. My aunt didn’t want
me ’round the house; no more did my cousin. So
I packed up what I had; it wasn’t much,” with a
rueful smile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> “and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Set out to seek your fortune. So far, if you
don’t mind my saying it, you don’t appear to have
succeeded very well. And so you want a job.
How have you been making your way?”</p>

<p>“Doing odd jobs for farmers and so on. I’m
clever at repairing automobile machinery, and I
earned a little that way. You see, my object was
to make my way here, otherwise I might have got
two or three jobs in garages or machine shops.”</p>

<p>“Why were you so anxious to come here?” demanded
Jack, beginning to feel an interest in this
persistent youngster.</p>

<p>“Because of a strange legacy my uncle left
me.”</p>

<p>“That’s an odd reason.”</p>

<p>“I know it; but may I explain?”</p>

<p>“Surely. Go ahead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, it was a legacy that he said would
bring me fame and fortune some day. It may
have been only an inventor’s dream. My poor
uncle had many such, or it may not be all that
he thought of it. There were many reasons why
I couldn’t consult any one in my own town about
it, and as I’d read of you and felt I could trust
you and your advice, I sought you out. But if the
invention, for that’s what the legacy was, is
worth anything or not, I want a job.”</p>

<p>“Come on inside, Nevins. You seem to have
the right stuff in you. We’ll have a talk.”</p>

<p>And with a wide-eyed youth behind him, Jack
led the way into the workshop. Sam Hinkley
viewed his young employer and the latter’s companion
with marked disfavor from his work
bench.</p>

<p>“Wormed your way into the place already,
have you?” he muttered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> “I’ll keep my eye on
you, young fellow, and don’t you forget it.”</p>

<small>AN INVENTION DESCRIBED.</small></h2>


<p>Ned Nevins had told nothing but the simple
truth when he stated that he had endured many
hardships and much rough travel under unpleasant
conditions in order to obtain an interview
with the Boy Inventors.</p>

<p>He was a boy of singularly firm character and
persistency or he would never have triumphed
over the obstacles he had conquered in order to
gain his ambition. When Ned’s uncle, Jeptha
Nevins, had died, he had entrusted to the boy
the tin box which we have seen Ned guarding
with so much care. It contained plans and specifications
of an invention upon which the elder
Nevins had spent all his spare time for many
years.</p>

<p>Whether the invention was a practical one or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
not, Ned, skillful as he was in the line of mechanics,
did not know. But his uncle’s faith in
the value of his invention was so great that he
had inspired his nephew with almost implicit confidence
in the soundness of his judgment.</p>

<p>Ned might have stayed in his home town and
awaited a more favorable opportunity for setting
out on his travels but for one thing. Jeptha Nevins
had a son, a hulking ne’er-do-well sort of lad,
or rather young man, for he was some years the
senior of Ned, who was sixteen.</p>

<p>Following his father’s death, “Hank” Nevins,
as he was known among his cronies, made a big
fuss when he learned that Ned had been left the
plans of Jeptha Nevins’ invention. There was
little else but the furniture in the house and a
small sum of money in the savings bank; and so
Hank Nevins laid formal claim to the plans of the
invention from which Jeptha Nevins had hoped
so much.</p>

<p>But Ned refused absolutely to give them up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Hank. With almost his dying words, Jeptha Nevins
had entrusted the plans to his nephew, for he
had long since given up hopes of making anything
out of Hank. In fact Ned knew that it had
been his uncle’s wish that Hank should know
nothing of the invention, but in some way the
latter had discovered the fact of its existence, and
he hoped, that by selling it, (provided it was in
any way practical,) he might obtain some money
which he could expend in dissipation.</p>

<p>When he found that Ned was unwilling, or
rather refused absolutely, to give up the plans,
Hank had flung out of the house with all manner
of threats, among them being that he would
force his cousin to give up the coveted plans by
process of law. Ned knew nothing of law and
like many persons similarly situated, the idea of
Hank’s resorting to lawyers to obtain possession
of the plans alarmed him. Among Hank’s acquaintances
was a young law clerk of “sporty”
proclivities. With the aid of this young limb of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the law, Hank had succeeded in thoroughly
alarming Ned as to the legality of his retention of
the papers. Matters were constituted thus when
Ned determined not to risk the possession of his
uncle’s plans any longer but to leave the small
cottage, where they all lived, and seek counsel and
aid elsewhere than in his native village.</p>

<p>From the first time he had read of them, the
Boy Inventors had possessed a large place in
Ned’s mind. In his extremity, therefore, he had
decided to seek them out and try to interest them
in the untried invention.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” said Jack, when the two boys were
inside a small room at one end of the workshop
which, for lack of a better word, was called the
office. It was a very business-like looking room.
Books on technical topics lined the shelves at one
end of it. Models, samples of materials, test-tubes
and other apparatus occupied most of the
rest of the available space.</p>

<p>Under the book shelves, however, was a desk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
It was to one of the chairs standing beside this
latter piece of furniture that Jack motioned his
odd guest.</p>

<p>Ned sank into the chair with an alacrity that
made it plain that he was tired. He had, in fact,
come some miles from his last stopping place that
morning.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry that you had that trouble with Sam
Hinkley,” began Jack in a kindly tone, “he should
have known better than to treat you as he did.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” the other assured him
hastily, “I’d have stood for a lot more than that
in order to get a chance to see you and tell you
what I’ve traveled a good way to say.”</p>

<p>“You said you had an invention, I think.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but it is not, properly speaking, mine,”
and then Ned Nevins went on briefly to describe
the circumstances by which he had come into possession
of the plans in which both he and his uncle
set so much store. But up to this point he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
not mentioned the nature of the invention and
Jack brought him to the point by a question.</p>

<p>“And just what may this invention be?”</p>

<p>Ned Nevins hesitated a few seconds before replying.</p>

<p>“I hardly know just what to call it,” he said,
“but I guess an electric hydroaeroplane about describes
it.”</p>

<p>Jack’s face betrayed his interest.</p>

<p>“You mean a craft capable of air and water
travel that is driven by electricity?” he asked.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>
<p>“That’s just it. But there are many novel
features about it, however. My uncle set most
store by one particular novelty in its construction,
and that was the fact that it was driven by electricity
instead of gasolene. Gasolene is bulky,
dangerous and heavy to carry, and sometimes
hard to obtain, but by using an electric generator,
worked while the machine is in motion, the Nevins
hydroaeroplane, as my uncle called it, has
plenty of cheap power always obtainable and is
simpler than gasolene-driven motors in a number
of ways.”</p>

<p>“But about your storage batteries&mdash;I suppose
that’s the idea?”</p>

<p>Ned Nevins nodded.</p>

<p>“That’s just the point I was coming to,” he
said; “one of the most notable features of the
Nevins hydroaeroplane is the fact that its power
is furnished by storage batteries many times
lighter than any yet constructed, and capable of
developing many times the power. But the plans
will show you all that far better than I can explain.”</p>

<p>“I should like to see them.”</p>

<p>Although he was interested and showed it,
Jack Chadwick had seen far too many impracticable
inventions to wax enthusiastic over any
scheme till he had examined into it for himself.
But he knew that if young Nevins had what he
said he had, he was in possession of a big thing.</p>

<p>So it was with considerable expectancy that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
he watched young Nevins fumble with the lock
of the battered tin case. Finally he opened the
receptacle and drew out a roll of papers. These
proved to be blue prints, and closely penned writings
covering several foolscap sheets.</p>

<p>Naturally, Jack’s attention was first directed to
the blue prints that young Nevins eagerly spread
out on the table before him. Accustomed as he
was to such things, he read the intricate lines and
tracings almost as plainly as print.</p>

<small>AN IMPORTANT DECISION.</small></h2>


<p>“Well, what do you think of it?”</p>

<p>Ned asked the question with almost pitiful
eagerness. His tone clearly betrayed how much
the answer meant to him.</p>

<p>“I think that the idea appears feasible, but of
course, I can’t say anything definite yet,” was
Jack’s rejoinder. “I will have to consult with
my cousin, Tom Jesson&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Ned nodded that he had heard of young Jesson,
who had had so much to do with the Boy Inventors’
work.</p>

<p>“And after we have gone over the plans together
we can tell you just what we think of it.
Suppose that the idea appears to be possible to
work out, what would your plans be?”</p>

<p>“That we each take an equal chance in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
profits that may come from it,” replied Ned in
quick, certain tones that showed he had thought
the matter out all clearly in his own mind.</p>

<p>“Well, that would come later. You would be
clearly entitled to more than a third share, for
the invention practically belongs to you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I have no capital to put into its manufacture.
My idea was that you would build the
craft, with me to help, for I know my uncle’s
ideas in regard to the craft backward, almost.”</p>

<p>Jack smiled.</p>

<p>“I see you have every detail figured out.”</p>

<p>“If you knew how much I have thought of it!”
exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“I can well imagine that. Well, Ned, I can
promise you one thing&mdash;if the invention offers
any possibility of success we will undertake it.
We have nothing on hand just now and this is
surely a big idea you have brought us.”</p>

<p>“I believe in it,” declared the boy fervently.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>
<p>“Well, that’s half the battle. Suppose you
come and see us to-morrow morning. We will
go over the plans to-night and see what we think
of them. By the way, where are you staying?”</p>

<p>“Nowhere just at present. I came straight up
here as soon as I arrived in Nestorville.”</p>

<p>“You must have been eager to see us.”</p>

<p>“I was, indeed. I had traveled a good many
miles to do so, as I explained.”</p>

<p>“Well, Sam Hinkley’s father keeps a sort of
hotel in Nestorville. It is cheaper than a regular
first-class place but I think you will find it comfortable.”</p>

<p>“Anything will suit me. I shan’t sleep much
to-night, anyhow,” replied Ned, taking no notice
of the name that Jack had mentioned.</p>

<p>“Don’t build too many hopes, Ned. I should
hate to have to disappoint you.”</p>

<p>The boys shook hands and parted. Jack
watched the dusty figure of Ned Nevins as the
boy wended his way down the hill.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>
<p>“There goes a boy with the right stuff in him,”
he said to himself. Although he was young in
years, Jack Chadwick was ripe in experience, as
those of our readers who have followed the adventures
of the Boy Inventors through the various
volumes know.</p>

<p>For the benefit of those who are making their
first acquaintance with the two lads, we will briefly
relate the careers of Jack Chadwick and Tom
Jesson, his cousin, up to the time that we resume
our friendship with them in the present book.</p>

<p>Jack Chadwick’s father was the famous Professor
Chadwick, whose various inventions had
made him well-to-do, and who was known
throughout the civilized world. The Chadwick
method of steel reduction and the same inventor’s
ingenious devices for rock boring and drilling
came to the notice of the general public during
the construction of the Panama Canal. But
Professor Chadwick had to his credit a host of
other inventions which, if not quite so well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
known to the world at large, none the less played
a large part in the history of civilization.</p>

<p>The Professor, whose wife had died soon after
Jack’s birth and before fame came to him, had
purchased the estate of High Towers, lying a
short distance from the pretty little town of Nestorville
as a secluded place in which to carry on
his researches. Not long after he had acquired it,
Mr. Jasper Jesson, his brother-in-law and a well-known
explorer and biologist, was reported missing
while on an expedition in the tropics. As Mr.
Jesson was also a widower, the care of young
Tom Jesson, the explorer’s only child, devolved
upon Prof. Chadwick.</p>

<p>Jack Chadwick and Tom Jesson had thus practically
grown up together and were more like
brothers than cousins. As time went on, both lads
developed a strong liking for pursuits similar to
the Professor’s, and when still a young boy, Jack
had invented a patent churn, which came into
wide use, as well as improving many household<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
devices. The Professor was delighted with the
skill and adaptability of both boys, and aided
them all he could in their chosen pursuits. They
both took technical courses at a school in Boston,
not far from which city Nestorville was situated.</p>

<p>Aeronautics before long began to engage their
attention to the exclusion of every other study.
Professor Chadwick, too, was interested in this
topic, which was developed at High Towers, together
with some experiments in an improved
wireless plant.</p>

<p>In the first volume of this series, “The Boy
Inventors’ Wireless Triumph,” we saw how the
boys’ hard work bore fruit in an adventurous
voyage to Yucatan. They participated in many
thrilling adventures and dangerous experiences
which culminated in the finding of Tom Jesson’s
long missing father.</p>

<p>The next volume showed the boys in a new
field of endeavor. There is brotherhood among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
inventors, and when a friend of Mr. Chadwick’s,
who was perplexed by problems connected with
a new sort of gun, came to them they were glad to
aid him in any way they could.</p>

<p>This work involved them in a surprising series
of experiences, not all of which were pleasant.
In fact, at times, every ounce of resource, courage
and perseverance, which both lads possessed
to a high degree, was called into requisition to
bring them out of their difficulties. This volume
was called “The Boy Inventors’ Vanishing Gun,”
and related, in considerable detail, the final triumphant
outcome of the trials and tribulations
which had beset the youthful mechanics.</p>

<p>In the third book dealing with our young
friends, we found them essaying triumphs in a
new element. This volume was called “The Boy
Inventors’ Diving Torpedo Boat.” The boat was
a masterpiece of mechanical construction and a
long cruise the boys took in her under the surface
of the waves provided a narrative of surpassing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
interest and gripping power. By the aid of their
submarine torpedo boat the boys were enabled to
play an important part in succoring some beleaguered
Americans, who were in peril of their
lives at the hands of a band of bloodthirsty Cuban
revolutionists. The boys were put to a hard test
during this period of their lives, but after all,
their experiences endowed them with increased
self-reliance and manliness which was to prove
of inestimable benefit to them later on, when these
qualities brought them successfully through adventures
and trials more rigorous than any they
had yet faced.</p>

<p>A Flying Ship was their next craft and in her
the boys ventured on a unique quest through
the untrodden regions of the Upper Amazon.
An odd German professor was their companion
and mentor. This was Professor Bismarck Von
Dinkelspeil, who was as kind-hearted as he was
eccentric. Professor Von Dinkelspeil was in
search of an extraordinary inhabitant of the re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>mote
Brazilian jungles. The boys met him in a
strange way and were enabled to offer him much
assistance. Dick Donovan, a lively young reporter,
and Captain Abe Sprowl, a rough-and-ready
New England skipper, were others of their
companions on what proved a unique cruise, the
details of which were fully set forth in the volume
immediately preceding the present, which
was called “The Boy Inventors’ Flying Ship.”</p>

<p>Naturally interested in aeronautics as they
were then, the two lads went into “executive session”
over the plans of Ned Nevins’ electrical
hydroaeroplane as soon as Tom Jesson returned
from Boston, which was late that afternoon. He
had gone to the city to order some materials
needed in a new landing device the boys were
working on. Far into the night the two boys
pored over the plans, waxing more and more enthusiastic
as they progressed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>
<p>“It seems to me that this craft is as practical
and as possible to construct as an electric roadster,”
declared Jack, as they concluded their
labors.</p>

<p>“To build, yes, but how about it working when
it is built?” said Tom Jesson, who was less of an
idealist than his enthusiastic cousin.</p>

<p>“Are you willing to try it, Tom?”</p>

<p>“I am, yes. How about you?”</p>

<p>“I’m confident enough of success to risk some
of the money we made out of that Yucatan treasure
chest.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll contribute my share, too. When
do we start?”</p>

<p>“Nothing to hinder us getting on the job right
away. This is too big a thing to keep waiting.
We’ll send for Ned Nevins first thing in the
morning. If this invention turns out half as well
as it looks, his legacy will make him famous as
well as relieve him from want.”</p>

<p>Possibly, if the boys could have looked into the
future, Jack would not have spoken so confidently.
Troubles they never dreamed of lay ahead of
them, and, at that, in the near future.</p>

<small>NED TO THE RESCUE.</small></h2>


<p>In the meantime, Ned Nevins had retraced his
steps to Nestorville. It was a pleasant little village,
with neat, white houses lining its elm-bordered
streets, each with its trim lawn and flower
beds. To the boy who had been wandering in the
dusty roads so long, it appeared wonderfully
homelike and pleasant, although his travel-stained
garments looked doubly distasteful to him
in the midst of so much neatness and unobtrusive
prosperity.</p>

<p>He passed the main hotel of the place and continued
down High Street till he came to a rather
less pretentious-looking place, bearing over its
door the name, “The Hinkley House.” It was
not until then that Ned suddenly recollected that
Hinkley was the name by which Jack had re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>ferred
to the disagreeable youth up at the workshop.</p>

<p>“Wonder if he’s any relation?” thought Ned
to himself as he ascended the steps and entered
the office.</p>

<p>A man with bristly red hair, and a not over-pleasant
expression of countenance, stood behind
the desk writing in a big book.</p>

<p>“Well, boy?” he asked sharply, as Ned entered
the place. “If you’re selling anything we don’t
want nothing.”</p>

<p>And then he resumed his writing without taking
any more notice of Ned, who eyed him rather
amusedly for a few seconds. Then he addressed
him in a pleasant tone.</p>

<p>“I should like to get a room here, please.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” the red-haired man looked up with
a grunt rather suggestive of a certain barnyard
animal. “A room, did you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. An inexpensive one. In fact, as
cheap a one as you have.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure <em>you</em> can pay for it?” was the uncompromising
reply.</p>

<p>“I certainly can or I shouldn’t have asked you
for it,” said Ned, with the same flash in his eyes
as had come there when Sam Hinkley had addressed
him so rudely that morning.</p>

<p>Apparently the landlord of the Hinkley House
concluded that he had gone far enough, for in a
more amiable tone he said:</p>

<p>“I can let you have a good room for a dollar.
Want your meals?”</p>

<p>“For to-day anyway,” responded Ned, who had
saved from his garage work along the road
enough to make him feel sure of himself for a
short time, anyhow.</p>

<p>The business was soon concluded and Ned was
at liberty to go up to his room. As soon as he
was alone, he drew a chair to the window and sat
there thinking deeply. Naturally his thoughts all
reverted to one subject, and that was: what
would be the verdict at High Towers?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>“If they only knew how much depended upon
it,” thought the boy to himself, and then his fancy
roamed back to that final scene when he had
looked on his uncle for the last time and had received
what to him was almost a sacred trust.
From this his thoughts turned to his ne’er-do-well
cousin and the latter’s threats. His uncle had
left no will and Ned was not quite certain in his
own mind if he had any legal rights to the papers
dealing with the electric hydroaeroplane.</p>

<p>“If they were to find out where I had come,
they might try to make it unpleasant for me,” he
thought with a momentary qualm, but the next
moment he put these thoughts aside, and when he
descended to dinner he was in a cheerful, hopeful
frame of mind.</p>

<p>Mine host Hinkley’s meals were not of the sort
that could be described as Lucullan, but they were
solid, and Ned ate with the hearty appetite of a
growing boy. After he had finished, he decided
to saunter out and see what he could of the town.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
It would at least help to pass away the time till
the next day, upon which he felt his fate hung.
For the life of him he could not have settled down
to read or write till he knew definitely what the
verdict upon his unique legacy was to be.</p>

<p>In this frame of mind he wandered through the
main street of the little town, which did not take
very long, and soon found himself out upon the
high road. The road was a pleasant winding one,
and Ned walked on briskly, turning over in his
mind, as he went, the many events that had recently
transpired to work such a change in his
career. He could not help an exultant leap of
the heart as he thought of the possible outcome of
a favorable opinion of the dead inventor’s great
lifework.</p>

<p>He was still revolving this thought in his mind
when, on rounding a turn in the winding road, he
came across a sight which temporarily put all
other thoughts aside.</p>

<p>Stalled in the center of the road was a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>fine looking
automobile. Ned, who, as we know,
knew a lot about cars, recognized it as a machine
of expensive make and as an imported car. Bent
over the engine was a man who appeared to be
trying to adjust whatever was the matter with
the motor. Standing about were two other men.
As Ned came up, one of them turned to him.</p>

<p>“Here, boy, do you know if there’s a garage in
Nestorville?”</p>

<p>Now, Ned knew that there was not, for he had
looked about for one, thinking that if his mission
at High Towers failed, he might chance to get
employment in such a place till he got money
enough to find a better job. So he replied in the
negative.</p>

<p>The man, who wore auto goggles, and was big
and broad, turned to his companion with a gesture
of annoyance.</p>

<p>“Too bad, Smithers,” he said in a vexed tone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
“if Elmer there can’t fix that motor we’ll have to
leave the car here and telephone into Boston for
another.”</p>

<p>The chauffeur straightened up from his labors
over the refractory motor.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’re stuck, sir,” he said, “this car
is a Dolores. If it was any American car now, I
could&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never mind that,” interrupted the big man,
with an impatient gesture. “I hired you as a
competent chauffeur and now the first break-down
we have&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If it was an American car,” protested the
man. “I don’t understand these Dolores and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Maybe I can help you.”</p>

<p>It was Ned who spoke and the big man faced
round on him in surprise.</p>

<p>“You!” he exclaimed. “What do you know
about cars?”</p>

<p>“A little, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, at any rate you can’t know less than
Elmer,” said the big man with a disgusted look
at his chauffeur, who looked downcast and
abashed. “What do you want to do?”</p>

<p>“See if I can get your car going for you. I’m
interested in this sort of thing, you know.”</p>

<p>“Umph! don’t look as if you owned a car,”
commented the man who had been addressed as
“Smithers.”</p>

<p>“That’ll do, Smithers,” spoke up the big man
sharply. “Elmer owns that he’s up against it, so
give the boy a chance to show what he can do.”</p>

<p>In one garage where he had worked for a time
the “big man of the place” had owned, as it so
happened, a Dolores car. Therefore Ned was not
at sea when, in the overalls he had borrowed from
the chauffeur, he set to work on the stubborn
motor.</p>

<p>“Think you can fix it?” asked the big man,
after Ned had requested the chauffeur to start
the engine so that he could hear just what was
the matter with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Ned frankly. “It’s missing
in two cylinders. Carburetor trouble, I
think. The Dolores has a special make of carburetor,
you know, a very sensitive and complicated
variety.”</p>

<p>“Go to it, kid,” muttered the chauffeur. “If
you can fix that mixed-up muss of springs and
air-valves you’re a wonder.”</p>

<p>“If you’ll slow down the engine a while, I’ll
try,” said Ned, determined to do his best. It was
characteristic of him that he was as interested in
this vagrant bit of roadside trouble that had come
his way as he would have been in some problem
directly concerning himself. As it so happened,
however, the problem he was about to try to solve
did concern him and, at that, in no very distant
manner.</p>

<p>Of this, however, he was not to become aware
till later, and then in a manner which startled
and rather alarmed him, considering the consequences
it involved. But in blissful ignorance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
all this, Ned went to work, determined to do all
in his power to convince the two rather sceptical
autoists that he was not boasting when he had
said he thought he could help them out of their
difficulties.</p>

<small>THE UNLUCKY STORY.</small></h2>


<p>“Once more&mdash;that’s it!”</p>

<p>Ned suspended his labors for a moment and
listened to the tune of the throbbing motor as the
chauffeur started it up, following Ned’s adjustment
of the carburetor.</p>

<p>“It’s working better already,” declared the big
man. “Boy, you’re a wizard.”</p>

<p>Ned looked up smilingly. In the interest of the
work, and the fascination he always felt in conquering
the whims of a stubborn bit of machinery,
he had quite forgotten for the moment all
his trials and perplexities.</p>

<p>“I think I’m getting there all right,” he said
confidently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> “but it will take a little more time to
fix it just right.”</p>

<p>“Ah! You believe in doing things thoroughly,
I see.”</p>

<p>“I do, sir. Whatever is worth doing is worth
doing well.”</p>

<p>“That’s a belief that will get you a long way in
life, my boy,” said the big man. Ned hardly
heard him, for the motor was once more roaring
and pulsing. He tuned it up, listening to its explosions
as a skilled musician might hearken critically
to a piece of music.</p>

<p>As he listened, he tightened up a connection
here or loosened a valve there till the big six-cylindered
motor was humming with the even
pulsations of a sleeping baby.</p>

<p>“You can shut her off,” said he, addressing the
chauffeur, and then turning to the big man he
added, “I think you’ll find no more trouble, sir.”</p>

<p>“What! You have adjusted it, my boy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>“As well as I can, sir, and, without bragging, I
guess you’ll find everything all right now.”</p>

<p>“How long will it remain so?” asked the sceptical
Smithers.</p>

<p>“For several weeks, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“You may take the wheel again, Elmer, and
hustle us along. Young man, that you’re a mechanic
of no mean ability I could see by the way
you went to work. What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Ned Nevins, sir.”</p>

<p>“Live here?”</p>

<p>“I do just now, but I come from Millville,
N. Y.”</p>

<p>The big man looked surprised.</p>

<p>“Are you any relation to Jeptha Nevins?”</p>

<p>“His nephew, sir. Did you know him?”</p>

<p>“Very well. I am Vaughn Kessler, the owner
of the Kessler Mill. Your uncle was my foreman
for many years. He was one of the best
men we ever had; I was very sorry to hear of his
death. Is there anything I can do for you?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, sir, except&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>“Except what? Come, you’ll pardon my saying
so, but you don’t look&mdash;well, very prosperous.”</p>

<p>“I am all right, thank you, sir, and have good
prospects ahead of me,” replied Ned. “What I
was going to ask you was not to mention my name
in Millville or to say where you saw me if by
any chance anyone should ask you.”</p>

<p>“But why? You are not under a cloud there
surely, and if&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, no sir! It is for quite another reason,”
said Ned earnestly.</p>

<p>“Well, it shall be as you wish,” said Mr. Kessler,
regarding the boy with some curiosity,
“though why in the world you should make the
request puzzles me. Good-bye, my boy, and
thank you.”</p>

<p>He held out his hand and took Ned’s. The
next minute the car that the boy had so cleverly
placed back in running order moved swiftly off.
As it receded along the road, Ned became con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>scious
that there was something in his hand. It
had been left by Mr. Kessler.</p>

<p>“It’s money!” exclaimed the boy, unclasping
his fist. “Well, it won’t come amiss, although I
wouldn’t have thought of charging him for that
little job.”</p>

<p>He unfolded the bill and then gave a little cry
of astonishment. It was for twenty dollars,&mdash;a
small fortune to Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, I am in luck!” he exclaimed. “If only
my fortunes have changed, as this seems to indicate,
I’ll be lucky to-morrow as well, and that
is the dearest wish of my heart.”</p>

<p>It was well for Ned’s peace of mind that he
did not know that Mr. Kessler, while fully intending
to keep his promise of not mentioning
Ned’s name or address at home in Millville, unconsciously
let the cat out of the bag when he
arrived at Lowell, Mass., his destination. His
important interests, and those of his traveling
companion, Mr. Smithers, made him a big man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
there and the late arrival of his automobile,
which kept a momentous meeting waiting, called
for explanations. To the newspaper men of
Lowell, Mr. Kessler told how he had been aided
by a shabbily clothed boy on a country road when
a trained chauffeur had failed to adjust his car.
It made an interesting story, and was telegraphed
over the country by a correspondent of a news
association. In due course it appeared in the
Millville papers under this heading:</p>

<p class="center">
MILLVILLE MAGNATE AIDED<br />
BY A LAD FROM THIS CITY.</p>
<p class="center">
Vaughn Kessler’s Stalled Auto Started<br />
By Ned Nevins, Motor Genius.</p>

<p>The article beneath these headlines described
the whole incident briefly, and stated that Ned
was at present residing in the village of Nestorville,
Mass. With but few exceptions, the fact
that Mr. Kessler was concerned in the story was
the chief feature of interest to readers of the
article.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>One individual in Millville read it with burning
eyes. This was Hank Nevins, Ned’s cousin.
Following Ned’s disappearance, he had used
every means in his power to locate the boy. For
this he had a good reason. Not alone did he want
to recover the plans and designs of the electric
hydroaeroplane, but he was prepared to offer a
price for them.</p>

<p>While Ned had been making his preparations
to depart quietly from home, Hank, on the advice
of his lawyer friend, had visited the head of an
aeroplane manufacturing concern who happened
to be visiting Millville. Hank had laid before
the stranger as full a description as he could of
his father’s invention. He left out many important
points but the stranger was quick to see possibilities
in the idea and offered Hank a substantial
sum if he would bring him the plans.</p>

<p>The offer aroused all of Hank’s cupidity. He
saw a way, as he thought, to a life of elegant
leisure. Only one stumbling block interposed it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>self,
and that was a seemingly insurmountable
one.</p>

<p>Ned had vanished, and with him the papers
that would have meant money to Hank. On the
advice of his legal friend, Hank had advertised
for Ned in the personal columns of half a dozen
newspapers. But none of the carefully worded
appeals to the boy to reveal himself had borne
fruit. Hank was obliged to confess to Mr. Melville
of the Blue Sky Aeroplane Company that he
would be delayed in producing the plans, not admitting
that it would be extremely unlikely that
he could ever get possession of them at all.</p>

<p>“Well, any time you have them bring them to
me,” said Mr. Melville before he left Millville.
“And my offer will hold good.”</p>

<p>Hank’s thoughts were not very pleasant ones
as he left the aeroplane man’s presence.</p>

<p>“The young blackguard, to run off like that,”
he grumbled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> “Those plans mean dollars and
cents now. How can I get them? If I could locate
that runaway brat, I’d soon find a way.”</p>

<p>And now, through that unfortunate article in
the <cite>Millville Clarion</cite>, Ned Nevins’ hiding place
had been revealed to the last person on earth
Ned would have wished to have known of it.</p>

<p>That night, as soon as his work was done,
Hank sought out his budding lawyer friend. The
law, like all other professions, has its black sheep.
Hank’s friend bade fair to become one of these
when he should ultimately be admitted to practice,
which was his ambition. His eyes glistened
when he heard of Hank’s discovery.</p>

<p>“If only we could get those papers,” muttered
Hank, as the two sat together that night. “We’d
both have money to burn, Miles.”</p>

<p>Miles Sharkey was the name of Hank’s
crony, and the latter part of his appellation suited
him from the ground up. In his projecting yellow
teeth and undershot jaw, as well as in his
fishy, shifting eyes, there was something sugges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>tive
of the rapaciousness and treachery of a
shark.</p>

<p>“I think I can find a way to make him give
them up, Hank,” said Miles, after some moments
spent in deep thought, “but it may take a little
time to work out the details. Have you any idea
what he can be doing in this Nestorville place?”</p>

<p>“Not on the first guess. Just a crazy notion of
his, I reckon. But what’s your plan, Miles.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to think out the details,” rejoined the
redoubtable limb of the law, rubbing his tallowy
hands together. “But I think we’ll be able to
make Cousin Ned disgorge before very long&mdash;for
a consideration.”</p>

<p>“On the day I get my money, you get yours,”
Hank assured him.</p>

<p>“Consider it settled then,” said Miles. “I’d
have to be a pretty poor lawyer if I couldn’t think
of a way.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’m not particular about law,” blustered
Hank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> “anything to get those plans. He’s only
a kid, and once we’ve got ’em he can’t do anything.”</p>

<p>“It’s a great pity you didn’t get hold of them
before he skipped out,” said the worthy Miles.
“Anyhow, it’s all right. I’m smart enough to attend
to that.”</p>

<p>“Miles, you’re a true friend.” And as they
parted, Hank clasped his companion’s claw-like
hand with a fervor worthy of being bestowed on
a better man.</p>

<small>HIS ENEMIES ON THE TRAIL.</small></h2>


<p>Ned Nevins walked back to the hotel with his
brain in a whirl. In the first place, the twenty-dollar
bill which he fondly fingered as it lay in
his pocket, provided a stop-gap between want and
what he hardly dared to consider, and that was,
a refusal on the part of the Boy Inventors to have
anything to do with his cherished plans.</p>

<p>In the second place, his encounter with Vaughn
Kessler was a dubious source of satisfaction to
him. From one point of view it had, of course,
its pleasing side, but somehow, Ned could not
free himself of an uneasy feeling that in some
way the news of his whereabouts would get back
to Millville. In what a devious way this was to
happen he had, of course, no conception, and it
was just as well for his peace of mind that he
had not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>He arrived at the hotel a little time before supper,
and having cleaned himself up as well as
possible, and carefully brushed his hair and his
garments, he descended to the porch and sank
down into the most comfortable chair he could
find, one commanding a good view of the street.</p>

<p>A boy came along with papers, and feeling that
with his twenty-dollar bill snugly tucked in his
pocket he could afford to indulge in a few luxuries,
Ned bought two papers, one a local sheet,
the other a Boston daily. He looked through the
latter first and as his eye traveled down the columns
it was caught by the Personal Column.</p>

<p>In this section of the paper were published notices
to missing relatives and so forth. The type
used was large and heavy and calculated to catch
the eye.</p>

<p>What was Ned’s astonishment to suddenly spy
his own name at the head of a notice two or three
paragraphs from the top of the list. He stared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
at it in some wonder for a minute before he read
the notice itself.</p>

<p>“Why, who can be advertising for me?” he
thought, and with the thought came an uncomfortable
sensation at the recollection of the legal
processes with which his cousin had threatened
him.</p>

<p>“I’ll read the notice, that’s the best way of solving
the puzzle,” reflected the boy. Casting his
eye over the paragraph, he read as follows:</p>

<p>“Ned Nevins: It will be to your advantage to
communicate at once with your cousin at Millville,
N. Y. Big opportunity.&mdash;H. Nevins.”</p>

<p>“That’s Hank! what sort of a trick is he up to
now?” wondered Ned. “To ‘my advantage,’”
he musingly went on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> “I’d like to know what
there is to ‘my advantage’ that Hank would be
likely to take the trouble and expense to advertise
about. ‘Big opportunity’&mdash;yes, a ‘big opportunity’
to get his hands on those papers. The
idea of his thinking that I’d be softy enough to
answer such an ’ad’! No, indeed, you’ll never
locate me in that way. I’m glad I asked Mr.
Kessler to say nothing about having seen me.
Hank is working harder than I thought possible
for him to locate me, but he won’t do it if I can
help it.”</p>

<p>Which shows that Ned, like most of the rest of
us, placed undue confidence in his own ability to
avoid unpleasantness. We already know how
Fate was at work to over-reach him, playing with
what appeared to be malignant favoritism, into
the hands of those who wished him harm.</p>

<p>He was roused from his reverie by the sound
of a quick step behind him, and then a hand was
placed none too gently on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“It’s that fresh kid again!” exclaimed a grating,
unpleasant voice. “Get up out of that chair
instantly&mdash;do you hear me?”</p>

<p>“It’s Sam Hinkley!” exclaimed Ned to himself,
without, however, looking around. Aloud he demanded:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, what do you want?”</p>

<p>“That chair.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately it is, as you see, occupied.”</p>

<p>“I wish it at once!”</p>

<p>“You do?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“You have a cool way of asking for it. Suppose
I don’t give it to you?”</p>

<p>“You’ll be made to!”</p>

<p>“Who’ll make me?”</p>

<p>“I will, I guess. You don’t know who I am?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I do. Your name is Sam Hinkley.
I had a little argument with you this morning
in which you came out second best, I fancy.”</p>

<p>“I’ll teach you a lesson, you tramp. Are you
going to get up?”</p>

<p>“When the supper bell rings, I mean to.”</p>

<p>“Not till then?”</p>

<p>“No thanks, I’m very comfortable where I
am.”</p>

<p>“That’s my chair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indeed, I thought it was one of those placed
out here for the benefit of the guests.”</p>

<p>“So it is.”</p>

<p>“Well, I happen to be one.”</p>

<p>This answer took the blustering Sam rather
aback. He thought that Ned had sought a chance
to rest himself at the expense of the hotel’s hospitality.
But it suited his purpose to appear incredulous.</p>

<p>“They don’t take in vagabonds here.”</p>

<p>It was more than flesh and blood could stand.
Ned was about to leap to his feet when he was
spared that trouble by the chair being yanked
from under him, and he fell sprawling on the
floor of the porch.</p>

<p>“Haw! haw! haw!” bawled Sam, in high good
humor at seeing Ned in such an undignified position.</p>

<p>“Ho! ho! ho!” echoed half a dozen of Sam’s
cronies, who had been passing with him when
he had spied Ned, to whom Sam had taken an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
instinctive dislike. The “gang” had been invited
by Sam to see the “fun.” If it had not been on
the porch of his father’s hotel that Sam encountered
Ned, he would have hesitated to try issues
with him, for his experience of the morning had
shown him that Ned, slender and rather delicate-looking
as he was, was a foeman by no means to
be despised. But on home grounds he felt safe.</p>

<p>He was rather taken aback, therefore, when
Ned scrambled to his feet and advanced toward
him instead of retreating, as the bully had expected
Ned would do. There was a fire akindle
in Ned’s eyes that Sam by no means liked, for
he was at heart a coward, although accustomed
to lording it over other boys of his own age not
a little.</p>

<p>But with the eyes of his cronies fixed upon him
expectantly, he felt that he could not retreat.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” he asked, in a voice that
he tried to make belligerent, but which, somehow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
did not hold quite the warlike note he would have
liked.</p>

<p>“I want to give you something you need badly,”
said Ned, without raising his voice, but there
still glowed that same dangerous light in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Are you ready?”</p>

<p>“Rer-ready for what?” demanded Sam, in vain
trying to look unimpressed by this quiet, business-like
lad with the steady voice.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>
<p>“For what I fancy is to be your first lesson in
manners.”</p>



<hr class="chap" /><div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br />

<small>NED MAKES AN ENEMY.</small></h2>


<p>A wavering look of indecision crept into Sam
Hinkley’s pug-nosed countenance. He would
have liked to have the last few moments over
again. He felt that he would have acted differently.
But he tried to brazen it out.</p>

<p>“You strolling vagabond from goodness knows
where, take that!”</p>

<p>It was a vicious blow, with plenty of force behind
it, for Sam, although a bully and not possessed
of an overabundance of courage, was still
wiry and well muscled. But to his surprise his
blow did not land. It should have collided with
Ned’s chin, but when its force was expended, Ned
was not there.</p>

<p>He had stepped neatly aside and allowed Sam
to launch his thunderbolt harmlessly. Sa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>m’s
friends, grouped beneath the veranda on the
sidewalk, closed into a compact little crowd.
Plainly Sam was not going to carry all before
him as had been his habit hitherto. His cronies
saw this at once and some of them inwardly rejoiced.</p>

<p>The office of the little hotel was deserted, and
nobody interfered. Sam gathered himself together
to renew the combat. His brow grew
black. Ned stood waiting. He made no attempt
to defend himself. He merely eyed Sam Hinkley
with a look of contempt that maddened that
pugnacious bully.</p>

<p>Sam eyed his opponent viciously.</p>

<p>“Well?” queried Ned.</p>

<p>“Thought you were going to fight!” roared
Sam.</p>

<p>“As I told you before, I’m not a fighter.”</p>

<p>Sam rashly interpreted this as being a sign of
weakness. He rushed in once more, swinging
his big fists with more vigor than science. Once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
more Will-o’-the-Wisp Ned was not where he
ought to have been, and Sam, carried off his feet
by the vigor of his unopposed onslaught, collided
with a chair, tripped, and fell headlong on the
floor to the porch.</p>

<p>This time the laugh that went up was not at
Ned’s expense. The boy stood in the same quiet
attitude while Sam, his face crimson with anger
and mortification, gathered himself up.</p>

<p>“This ain’t fighting!” he bellowed angrily.</p>

<p>“You can call it anything you like&mdash;an acrobatic
performance if you wish,” rejoined Ned,
without raising his voice or changing his position.</p>

<p>Now there is nothing more irritating than to
lose your temper and to make an exhibition of
yourself, while the one your rage is directed at
stands as steady and unmoved as a rock, hardly
deigning to reply to either threats or onslaughts.</p>

<p>Sam was almost beside himself with rage as,
with blazing eyes, he made another dash at Ned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
This time Ned did not step aside. He ducked
under Sam’s terrific left, and coming up, struck
the bully a blow in the ribs that caused that
worthy to emit a sound resembling:</p>

<p>“Oof!”</p>

<p>Ned took advantage of the momentary pause
in hostilities to speak.</p>

<p>“Look here, Hinkley,” said he. “I’m not a ruffian,
and I don’t like fighting. We’ll call this off
right here and now, if you say so. I’m willing&mdash;what
do you say?”</p>

<p>“That I’m going to give you the licking of your
life!” roared out the enraged Sam.</p>

<p>Again he rushed in, his arms working like twin
piston rods. This time Ned did not avoid the
other’s rush. There was a rapid exchange of
blows, and then suddenly&mdash;so suddenly that nobody
saw just how it had happened, Sam Hinkley’s
head was jerked back.</p>

<p>Whack! Ned had taken advantage of a fraction
of a second when the other was off his guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
and landed a stinging blow full on Sam’s pug
nose. With a roar of anger Sam rushed in to
retaliate. This time Ned was not quite quick
enough. He stepped sideways to avoid the other’s
onrush, but his foot slipped, and before he could
recover his balance a heavy blow from Sam’s
ponderous fist sent him spinning across the porch.</p>

<p>Sam’s adherents in the crowd watching the two
lads set up a shout of delight. A broad grin overspread
Sam’s face.</p>

<p>“Guess that finishes the lesson,” he jeered.</p>

<p>“On the contrary it’s only just begun,” retaliated
Ned, and before Sam knew just what had
happened, two smart blows had rattled against
his ribs, the force of them making his teeth chatter
as if with the cold.</p>

<p>But Sam speedily recovered himself, and for
the next few minutes it was give and take, with
the odds rather against Ned, who was lighter of
build than the bully, and who was constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
forced back by the latter’s rushes. Sam began
to think it was all over.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Manners’ Teacher, how about you
now?” he sneered tauntingly.</p>

<p>Ned did not reply, but he watched Sam like a
cat. He saw that the bully was beginning to wear
out under the fast work of the last few minutes.
His chest was heaving and his breath came pantingly.
He guessed that Sam would have been
glad to have called “quits” then and there.</p>

<p>But while Ned might have been willing enough
not to fight at the beginning of the battle, his
blood was up now, and he was determined to see
the thing through. He despised fighting as being
ruffianly and unnecessary, but, in a case like
the present, he felt that if he allowed Sam Hinkley
to walk over him, the latter would make it
next to impossible for him to remain in Nestorville.</p>

<p>He avoided another of Sam’s bull-like rushes
with an agile step backward. As Sam’s blow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
missed, Ned could hear him give a loud grunt, a
sound that told he was tiring.</p>

<p>“I’m wearing him down,” thought Ned, and
watched carefully for an opening that might afford
him a chance of terminating the battle.</p>

<p>Sam “rushed” Ned again. This time he, too,
appeared to be desirous of ending the fight by
a blow that would take all the fight out of his
lightly built opponent. But his blow landed on
thin air.</p>

<p>Ned’s opportunity had come. His fist shot out
like a streak of lightning. It struck Sam under
the chin, lifting him off his feet. He toppled and
fell backward, landing among the chairs with a
crash that sounded like a cook-stove falling
downstairs.</p>

<p>“That settles him!” cried some of the crowd
of boys that had gathered, and “settle” Sam it
did, in more senses than one, for, aroused by the
crash of his fall, the bully’s father issued from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a><br /><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a><br /><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the hotel and seizing his offspring by the scruff
of the neck, angrily bade him get inside.</p>

“I had his chair, you see, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’ll do, young feller,” said the elder Hinkley
brusquely, “that’s not the first time it’s happened.
Sam had a licking coming to him and he
got it. I ain’t got nothing to say, ’cepting that
supper’s ready when you are.”</p>

<p>And in this eventful manner ended Ned’s first
day in Nestorville. It had surely been an eventful
one, thought the boy, as he reviewed the various
experiences of the last twelve hours before
turning into bed.</p>

<p>He was just about to turn out the light when
his attention was attracted to the door-sill. Something
white was being shoved under the door into
the room. It was a folded bit of paper.</p>

<p>Ned sprang forward and picked it up. It was,
as he had guessed, a note. He opened it, and as
he perused its contents, a smile of good-natured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
contempt came over his face. This is what he
read:</p>

<p>“You think you are smart, but you ain’t
through with me yet. I’ll fix you and when I do
I’ll fix you good. S. Hinkley.”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” said Ned to himself, as he finished
reading.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> “I’ve not so many friends that I want
to make any enemies. But after all, the quarrel
was not of my making and I don’t intend to allow
Sam Hinkley’s threats to worry me.”</p>

<small>THE PLANS ACCEPTED.</small></h2>


<p>Ned presented himself at High Towers betimes
the next morning. He found Jack Chadwick
and Tom Jesson awaiting him at the workshop.
Mr. Chadwick was in New York attending
to some business connected with his interests.
Mr. Jesson was in Boston delivering a series of
biological lectures, so that the boys had the place
to themselves.</p>

<p>The eagerness of Ned to know the verdict of
the two Boy Inventors must have shown itself
very plainly on his face, for almost as soon as he
had been introduced to Tom Jesson, Jack hastened
to relieve the lad’s anxiety.</p>

<p>“I suppose you want to know if it’s good news
or bad?” asked Jack.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>“I’ve hardly slept all night thinking of it.”</p>

<p>“Then I have something to tell you that you
will be glad to hear. We will help you manufacture
the craft your uncle designed and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Ned’s glad outburst of thanks checked him for
a moment, but Jack went on to explain that he
and his cousin would take only one-quarter interest
in the craft, leaving the remainder free and
clear to Ned. The cost of manufacturing would
be borne by the Boy Inventors and the patents,
when the machine was completed, would rest in
Ned’s name.</p>

<p>“Is that satisfactory?” asked Jack when he had
finished.</p>

<p>“Satisfactory!” burst out Ned. “It’s generous&mdash;too
generous!”</p>

<p>“Not at all. So far as money is concerned,
when you know more about us, you will know
that Tom and I have plenty, most of it realized
from our inventions.”</p>

<p>“I know but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute. Here we are, just dying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
for a chance to get to work on something really
new and neither of us with brains enough to
think up anything. You come along with just
what we are looking for and we feel more like
thanking you than considering we are doing anything
wonderful.”</p>

<p>“Besides,” added Tom, “even one-quarter interest
in the electric hydroaeroplane ought to
yield a handsome profit.”</p>

<p>“If, and it’s a big ‘If,’” said Ned with a laugh,
“we can get it to work. If not&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We wouldn’t tackle it if we didn’t think it was
practicable,” said Jack decisively. “So that ends
that. Now come along, Ned, and be initiated into
the mysteries of the firm, for you know, you are
now a working partner.”</p>

<p>“Say, fellows!” burst out Ned enthusiastically.
“I don’t know how to thank you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. You help us out on building
the machine and that will be thanks enough.
When we’ve got it working, we’ll shine in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
reflected glory and that will be satisfaction
enough for us.”</p>

<p>The next hour was one of unmixed delight for
Ned, interested, nay wrapped up in mechanics as
he was. He had never seen a workshop fitted up
on such a scale as that of Jack Chadwick and Tom
Jesson,&mdash;a private workshop, that is. Lathes and
all sorts of machinery of the latest pattern were
driven by a powerful gasolene engine. Facilities
were at hand for making the parts of many of the
boys’ devices. Three skilled machinists were also
employed, and summoning them about him, Jack
Chadwick briefly outlined to the interested men
the big task they were about to undertake.</p>

<p>He was in the midst of his explanations, when
Sam Hinkley strolled in. Jack looked at him
sharply. One of his eyes was swollen and slightly
discolored. He glared at Ned savagely and
the look was not lost on Jack Chadwick.</p>

<p>As soon as he had an opportunity, Sam drew
Jack aside and demanded, in an indignant and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
aggrieved voice, to know if Ned Nevins was to
work in the shop.</p>

<p>“Yes, and on a partnership basis, too,” said
Jack enthusiastically. “He has been the means of
introducing us to a wonderful invention. We are
going to start in on the work of its construction
right away.”</p>

<p>Sam did not appear interested in this information
except that a jealous look crept into his eyes.</p>

<p>“I think you ought to know that he’s nothing
but a rowdy,” he said. “I’ll bet any invention
he’s been telling you about is a fake.”</p>

<p>“The plans look good to us,” responded Jack,
“and we are going to risk it. What have you got
against the boy, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“He’s a rowdy,” repeated Sam. “He blacked
my eye last night.”</p>

<p>Jack, who had a pretty good insight into Sam’s
character, could not repress a smile.</p>

<p>“I thought you were invincible, Sam.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t fight fair. He forced me into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
row,” grumbled Sam. “I could have licked him
all right if&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What had you been doing, Sam?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. He took my chair away and when
I wanted it back he said I’d have to fight for it
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you did,” commented Jack with a dry
smile. “Well, Sam, my advice is to forget it. If
you think you’ve been injured I’m sorry, but Ned
Nevins appears to me to be an inoffensive sort of
a lad, quiet and unassuming.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he just puts on that to fool you,” muttered
Sam.</p>

<p>At this juncture, Jack was called away by one
of the machinists and Sam, with a very bad grace,
turned to some unfinished work at his lathe. He
was still engaged at this when Ned happened to
pass by.</p>

<p>“I got your note last night, Hinkley,” he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
“Why didn’t you give it to me in person instead
of slipping it under the door?”</p>

<p>Sam made a sound resembling “G-r-r-r-r-r”
and went on with what he was doing.</p>

<p>“As I suppose you know,” resumed Ned, “we
shall see a good deal of each other in the future.
Why can’t we be friends?”</p>

<p>Sam’s face contorted with rage as he dropped
the tool he had been using and faced round on
Ned.</p>

<p>“Because I hate you, that’s why. You’re nothing
but an interloper and a faker and Jack
Chadwick will find it out before very long.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you think that, Sam.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Sam, surprised at the other’s
calm, even tone. His outburst appeared to have
no effect whatever upon the lad he had desired to
impress with his enmity.</p>

<p>“Because I am afraid you are going to be disappointed,”
and with these words Ned passed on.</p>

<p>The next few weeks were busy ones about the
workshop of the Boy Inventors, but gradually,
almost imperceptibly, the electric hydroaero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>plane
began to take shape. The enthusiasm of
the boys infected the workmen and even Sam
Hinkley appeared to work with more than usual
fervor.</p>

<p>Briefly described, the hydroaeroplane portion
of the craft consisted of two twin boats, each
about forty feet in length and constructed of a
special aluminum alloy jointed together by strong
vanadium connections. Between the pair of
boats, which will be more fully described later,
the storage tanks, which were the novel feature
of the Jeptha Nevins craft, were placed.</p>

<p>In the center of each of the boats was a small
raised cabin, the cabins being connected by a
hollow passageway. At either end of the craft
the wings, of biplane pattern, were attached.
The wing spread was ninety-five feet which, with
the craft’s electric engines of enormous power,
gave the giant air-craft a lifting capacity of two
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>Above the storage batteries, and between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
twin “boats,” were the motors, each coupled to
two sets of propellers placed fore and aft on
either end of the craft and outside of the wings.
A light, but strong, framework supported the
outer bearings of the propellers and served to
give them sufficient projection to insure balance.
The forward set of propellers were so “pitched”
as to pull the craft through the air, while the after
ones furnished a driving impulse.</p>

<p>One of the most important features of the invention
was the device by which electricity was
made while she was in flight or skimming over
the water. This was a generator of considerable
power geared to the shafts of the propellers. As
the craft drove along, the storage batteries were
constantly recharged by this device. For the
initial, or starting “charge” the batteries were
furnished with “juice” by a small compressed air-driven
generator which could also be used in case
of accident to the automatically driven device.
Thus the necessity of gasolene was done away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
with and the Nevins craft was equipped, so far
as power was concerned, to cross the Atlantic
Ocean. But, of course, no such project entered
into the minds of her young constructors.</p>

<p>The planes themselves were covered with
sheets of aluminum attached to frames of radiolite,
a metal as light as aluminum and of great
tensile strength. Landing wheels, supported by
powerful shock absorbers, provided for alighting,
and special balancing devices, attached to the
bow and to the stern of the novel craft, minimized
the danger of coming to earth with too
great a shock to the weighty fabric.</p>

<p>On the top of each cabin was a powerful
search-light, and each was fitted out with two
bunks and other conveniences as in the stateroom
of an ocean liner. The pilot house was mounted
above the covered passage, or tube, already referred
to, which connected the two parts of the
craft. It contained a wheel not unlike that of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
ocean liner and levers to control the balancing
wings and the pitch of the planes.</p>

<p>As for the engine-controls, the motor being
electrically driven, the machinery to control it
was wonderfully simple. An apparatus not unlike
a switchboard, as may be seen in any powerhouse,
was mounted within convenient reach of
the helmsman. The light controls also were affixed
to this board. Mastery of the huge craft
was within instant power of the driver. A signaling
system to each cabin, in case of emergency,
was another feature added to the general completeness
of the equipment.</p>

<p>Such is a brief description of the Nevins electric
hydroaeroplane, a craft in which the Boy
Inventors were destined to meet as strange adventures
as had ever fallen to their lot.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a><br />

<small>THE ARRIVAL OF TROUBLE.</small></h2>


<p>It would be tedious to dwell upon the details of
the construction of the craft which the boys, by
unanimous vote, had decided to call the Electric
Monarch. The work went steadily on and Prof.
Chadwick, who had returned soon after the boys
started work, rendered them valuable assistance.
The previous experience with aerial craft, which
the Boy Inventors had had, made the work progress
far more rapidly than would otherwise have
been the case, although the plans and drawings
left by Jeptha Nevins were so detailed and exact
that they encountered but few very knotty problems.</p>

<p>One day, not very long before the Electric
Monarch, which had been finished in scarlet and
silver, was ready for her trial trip, two strangers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
appeared at the Hinkley House. One was a
broad-shouldered, clumsy-looking young man
with a shock of black hair and carelessly brushed
clothes, the other a tall, cadaverous-looking person
of about the same age with shifty, rat-like
eyes and a general air of furtive watchfulness.</p>

<p>Some time before this event, Ned, as an active
partner in the firm of the Boy Inventors, had
taken up his residence at High Towers. There
were two reasons for this. One was that it was
far more convenient to the work which was being
rushed to completion, the other that as the Electric
Monarch neared the day for her trial trip,
Ned grew more and more nervous about leaving
the craft unwatched.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he had a small cot fixed up in the
corner of the workshop where he slept at night.
Ned himself would have been at a loss to account
for this nervousness; nevertheless he felt a vague
mistrust. It was not that he feared any harm
Sam Hinkley might do to the craft, for although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
there was no love lost toward Ned on Sam’s part,
Ned was pretty sure that the Hinkley boy would
not dare take active reprisals. But yet he felt
that it was well to observe caution.</p>

<p>Sam came and went to his work as usual, and
as he, as well as the other workmen, had given
their words not to let anything leak out about the
Electric Monarch till she was ready for a flight,
no uneasiness was felt about this circumstance.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, even if it had been known
that a big air craft was being constructed at
High Towers, it would not have excited much
comment in the village. The inhabitants of Nestorville
had grown too used to hearing about
strange inventions being built at the big house
on the hill to feel any undue curiosity about them.
And yet, Ned vaguely felt that danger threatened.</p>

<p>The two strangers gave out at the Hinkley
House that they were traveling for a drug firm.
They made themselves friendly with the proprie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>tor
who, after being presented with cigars, voted
them two “good fellows.” Perhaps he might
have thought them “inquisitive fellows,” too, if
soon after his new guests’ arrival, when he had
been summoned to answer a long-distance telephone,
he had noticed one of them slip up to the
register, open it and search hurriedly for a name.</p>

<p>“It’s there all right,” whispered the one who
had examined the book as he slipped out from behind
the desk again. “‘Ned Nevins&mdash;Boston.’ I
suppose he registered from there because he
didn’t want to run any chances of being asked
questions about Millville.”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder, Miles,” was the rejoinder
of Hank Nevins, “but he didn’t reckon that we
was just as slick as he is.”</p>

<p>The two “drug drummers” were Hank and his
unsavory lawyer friend, Miles Sharkey. The two
had been delayed in their pursuit of Ned by a
very important handicap, namely, lack of funds.
But on Hank having written to Mr. Mellville<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
that they were on the track of the plans and had
a good chance of securing them, the money for
their expenses, (much to the surprise of both of
them,) had been forwarded. They then lost no
time in heading for Nestorville and laying plans
for the recovery of the papers of the dead Jeptha
Nevins.</p>

<p>When Landlord Hinkley came out of the telephone-booth,
one of his new guests stepped up to
him.</p>

<p>“Recollect a young chap named Nevins?” he
asked. It may be said here that Hank and Miles
had registered under assumed names.</p>

<p>“Nevins?” repeated the landlord. “Nevins?
Well, I should just say I did.”</p>

<p>“Stop here long?” asked Miles insinuatingly.</p>

<p>“Quite a few days till he went to live with
them Chadwick boys up on the hill yonder.”</p>

<p>Hank and Miles exchanged significant glances.
They were on the trail indeed now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>“Um-er, the Chadwick boys,” began Miles at a
venture. “Chums of his, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so, in a manner of speaking. My
son Sam works for ’em, too. He’s a bright lad, is
Sam. Why, sir, I tell you around a bit of machinery
that boy’s a marvel. Only last week my
wife’s sewing machine went out of whack and
gosh ter mighty ef that boy Sam didn’t have it
all fixed up hunky dory in two shakes of a duck’s
tail. Nuther time&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>There is no knowing how long Mr. Hinkley
might have gone on extolling his son’s virtues had
it not been for the fact that Miles and Hank were
far too impatient to listen to a lengthy catalogue
of Sam’s bright doings.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” rejoined Miles. “I’ve no doubt
your son is a mighty bright boy, Mr. Hinkley.”</p>

<p>“Gets it from his father,” put in Hank with a
clumsy attempt at a compliment.</p>

<p>Crude as the attempt at flattery was, Landlord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Hinkley swallowed it whole. He smirked his acknowledgments.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Avery,” this was the name
Hank had registered under. “Very handsome of
you, I’m sure. Won’t you gentlemen hev a
cigar?”</p>

<p>Both the gentlemen accepted with thanks, and
while they puffed at Landlord Hinkley’s aromatic
weeds, they pursued further the subject that was
closest to their hearts.</p>

<p>“Fine cigars, these, Mr. Hinkley,” commented
Miles, with a wink at Hank to show that the remark
was ironical.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes indeed,” responded the landlord,
“Flor de Telphono, we call ’em. Telephone
cigars, you know.”</p>

<p>“Telephone cigars, that’s an odd name,” said
Hank, with a wry face over his weed. Hank was
one of those hollow-chested, pale-faced youths
who think it smart to smoke but do so only with
a great effort of will power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yep, they calls ’em that, the boys says, because
you can smoke ’em here and smell ’em in
Boston.”</p>

<p>This choice witticism having being properly
laughed at, Miles and Hank went further on their
“fishing expedition.”</p>

<p>“These Chadwick boys now,” pursued Hank,
“friends of young Nevins likely?”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I dunno. I reckon he’s working for
’em on some sort of contraption. You know these
Chadwick boys is right smart lads on such doodads.
The Boy Inventors, they call ’em. Reckon
maybe you’ve heard on ’em.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t know that I have,” rejoined Miles.
“So young Nevins is working for them, eh?”</p>

<p>“Er-huh. Has bin fer quite a spell.”</p>

<p>“Sort of mechanic, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, thar’ you got me,” admitted Mr. Hinkley.
“I hearn’,” he went on, sinking his voice and
growing confidential,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> “that them boys is working
on some sort of er flyin’ machine er some sech
foolishness.”</p>

<p>Miles and Hank flashed a glance of comprehension
between them. They had reached their goal,
then.</p>

<small>HEINY PUMPERNICK DILL.</small></h2>


<p>“Hey, you black feller, dis be der place py vere
der Poy Inventors vork, I don’t dink?”</p>

<p>Old Jupe, the Chadwicks’ colored factotum,
paused on his way from the village with a big
basket and looked his questioner over from head
to foot. It was an odd figure that he inspected.
He found himself facing a blond-haired youth
of about eighteen with apple-red cheeks and
bright, twinkling blue eyes.</p>

<p>Perched on the top of the youth’s tow-colored
head was a small derby rakishly tilted to one side.
A green bob-tailed coat&mdash;it had probably once
been black&mdash;was carefully buttoned over a striped
blue and white vest. The turned up ends of his
baggy trousers were so far from the tops of his
low, yellow shoes that they showed about two
inches of startling red socks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who you done calling black feller?” demanded
Jupe, with justifiable indignation. “Ah’m a
genelman ob color ah am, and I wants that mistinctly
undercunstumbled.”</p>

<p>“Vell, dond go py geddin’ a mads, Mister Gentelemans
vot vos colored,” said the tow-headed
youth in a conciliatory tone. “My name vos
Heiny Bumpernick Dill.”</p>

<p>For answer Jupe threw back his woolly head
and burst into a roar of laughter that showed two
rows of white, gleaming teeth between his thick
red lips.</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho! Ho!&mdash;Ha! Ha! Ha!” he exploded.
“Oh! gollyupmtions! ef dat ain’t mostest
funniest ting I eber heard.”</p>

<p>The tow-headed youth gazed at the negro’s
mirth with an expression that was at first amazed
and then grew rapidly indignant.</p>

<p>“Vos ist los midt you?” he demanded wrathfully.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>
<p>“Loose? Der ain’t nutting loose wid me, am
dere?” demanded Jupe, fingering his waist band
and in turn looking surprised.</p>

<p>“I saidt idt ‘Vos ist los!’” yelled the German
boy. “Vot is idt der madder midt you anyvay?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dat name! Golly to goodness, chile! Dat
name suttinly got on mah risibles. Heiny Pump
it quick&mdash;oh! ha! ha! ha!” and throwing back
his head, old Jupe went off into another spasm of
mirth.</p>

<p>“I saidt idt Bumpernick&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Was dat you say. Bumper&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nodt. Bumper-Bumper. P-U-M-P-ER&mdash;Bumper!”</p>

<p>Jupe scratched his woolly thatch. This was
getting too much for him.</p>

<p>“P-U-M-P-E-R spells Pumper, chile,” he said.</p>

<p>“Dots vot I saidt idt, aind’t it? Bumper&mdash;Bumbernick.
Dot’s my name, aind’t idt?”</p>

<p>“Say, lookah hyah, Massa Bumper, is you all

<p>“Vos dot you say? I am grazy?” bellowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Heiny Pumpernick. He dropped a little wickerwork
satchel he carried and doubled up his fists.</p>

<p>“I been adtletic feller alretty yet,” he shouted.
“You bed my life you no comes making der funs
by me, py chiminy, black feller!”</p>

<p>“Was dat? Who yo’ all calls black fellers&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;yaller-headed
Dutchman,” ejaculated
Jupe, thoroughly angry in his turn.</p>

<p>Now there is nothing on earth better calculated
to arouse a German’s ire than to call him a
Dutchman, and the same is the case when a negro
is addressed as a “black fellow” or a “nigger.”
Both the German youth and old Jupe were now
fighting mad.</p>

<p>“I calls idt to you, black fellers,” sputtered out
young Dill, doubling up his plump fists. “I’m
an adtletic feller, I pet you mein lifes. You calls
me Mister Dill oder I pust you vun py der nose.”</p>

<p>“Ho! ho! ef you all do dat you be a dill in er

<p>“Who is dot vot you calls a bickle? By chiminy,
nigger, look idt out midt yourself!”</p>

<p>Without more words the redoubtable Heiny
Pumpernick Dill let fly with his fists at Jupe who,
for his part, was ready enough to begin hostilities.
Now it so happened that this Homeric battle
took place on the banks of the large lake mentioned
in other volumes of this series. It was a
body of water used for experimenting with models
of craft of various kinds and had been the
scene of the testing out of the diving torpedo boat,
as readers of the volume dealing with that invention
will recollect.</p>

<p>The fist of the exasperated German youth, as
it leaped out, landed on a spot on Jupe’s anatomy
which, while it was not calculated to do him
much injury, still gave him plenty to think about.</p>

<p>“Woof! Wha’ fo’ yo’ alls hit me in der stomick?”
indignantly roared out Jupe. Without
more ado he dropped the basket he had been burdened
with and the lid burst open. Instantly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
ground was covered with a score of lively hard-shell
crabs, but in the heat of their anger neither
of the combatants noticed this.</p>

<p>Jupe’s retaliation for the German youth’s blow
was vigorous.</p>

<p>“Gollyumptions! Ah makes yo’ all call me a
genelman ob color befo’ ah kicks yo’n off’n these
hayar groun’s,” he cried indignantly.</p>

<p>The next minute it was Mr. Dill’s turn to cry
“Oof!”</p>

<p>But he quickly recovered and then, closing in,
the two pugilistic heroes engaged in a tussle
which speedily brought them in a rolling, kicking,
struggling heap to the ground. Over and over
they rolled on the banks of the lake and their
struggles speedily brought them among some of
the escaped crabs. These lost no time in dealing
with the combatants. One fastened itself into
young Dill’s long yellow hair while another seized
Jupe by the back of the neck. Two piercing yells
went up simultaneously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! Ouch! Help! De debbil am got hold
ob me by de neck!” roared out Jupe.</p>

<p>“Leggo mein hairs, py chiminy!” screeched the
German boy. “Himmel! Donner! Blitzen!”</p>

<p>Over and over they rolled, with the crabs holding
fast with a tenacious grip. Their struggles
quickly brought them to the bank of the lake.
What with anger, and what with pain, they were
past noticing anything and just as Jack and Tom,
who had been attracted by the uproar, came running
down the gravel walk to ascertain its cause,
a loud splash and a despairing yell announced the
fact that the two doughty heroes had plunged into
an element calculated to cool their wrath.</p>

<small>THE CONVERTIBLE SAUSAGE MACHINE.</small></h2>


<p>Jack and Tom arrived at the brink of the lake
just as the two combatants, sputtering and splashing
like a pair of grampuses, arose to the surface.</p>

<p>“It’s Jupe!” cried Jack, “but how in the name
of time?”</p>

<p>“But who is the other fellow?” shouted Tom.</p>

<p>“Never mind that now. Jupe can’t swim and
the water is deep there. We’ve got to get him
out.”</p>

<p>The boys speedily stripped off their coats and
kicked off their shoes preparatory to plunging
to the rescue, but before they could do this,
young Dill, who was a good swimmer, had seized
Jupe by the back of the neck and dragged him,
half drowned, to the shore. Jupe, dripping with
water and mud, clambered out little the worse,
except in appearance, for his adventure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>He was followed by young Dill, who was a
sorry-looking object indeed. The water had
caused the gaudy dye of his vest to run in great
streaks down his light-colored pants. His hat,
which had stuck to his head throughout the
struggle, was sending streams of green water
down over his rubicund face, while round his
feet, as he emerged from the lake and stood before
the boys, was a crimson puddle. The dye on
young Dill’s socks was certainly not of the “fast”
variety, except in color.</p>

<p>At the sight of the two extraordinary figures
Jack and Tom could hardly refrain from bursting
into roars of laughter. But they retained
their gravity and looked sternly at Jupe.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will explain what this means?”
began Jack.</p>

<p>“Ah-ah-ah-ah,” sputtered Jupe, opening and
shutting his mouth like a fish newly removed
from the water.</p>

<p>“Well, we are waiting,” said Jack, while Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
turned away, suddenly overcome by a mysterious
fit of coughing.</p>

<p>“Vait idt a minutes undt I vill explanation idt
to you,” volunteered young Dill. “Dis is der vay
idt vosn’t. I vos comin’ py der house to see der
Poy Inventors undt I asked idt ob dis black&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Jupe suddenly came to life. Shaking his woolly
head like a poodle he shouted out:</p>

<p>“Don’ you alls done go fer ter call me no black
feller,” he shouted.</p>

<p>“You no call idt to me Dutchman, I no call idt
to you black fellers, aber no mans call me Dutchman.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute! Wait a minute! What’s all
this about?” demanded Jack. “How are we to
understand anything with all this jabber? You
there, Mister&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Dill is mein name, sir,” said the young German
with a dignity which assorted oddly with his
weird appearance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<p>“Well, Mr. Dill, you appear to be in a pickle,”
said Jack with a grin he could not repress. “Will
you explain to me what was the cause of all this?”</p>

<p>“Ah-ah-ah,” began Jupe again, but Jack shook
his head at him and the voluble young Dill told
the story of the causes leading to the combat.</p>

<p>“Well, you both appear to have been well punished,”
said Jack when he concluded, “and now
perhaps you will tell me what you wanted to see
us about.”</p>

<p>“Vot I vanted to see you abodt ain’d it?”
asked the German boy.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I vanted to see idt der Poy Inventors alretty.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see them.” Young Dill’s face
showed his astonishment, but he wisely repressed
any comment. “What can we do for you?”</p>

<p>“You can do me for a fine inventions vot I haf,”
responded the German youth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> “I used to vurk
midt a delicatessens pefore I pecome an inventors.
I haf midt me in dis liddle satchel a motel
of mein inventions.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it? What is the nature of it?”
demanded Jack.</p>

<p>“Idt iss a new kindt of sissage machine,” explained
the proud youth, forgetting all about his
recent immersion in the glow of the inventor’s enthusiasm,
“chust py touching a lefer idt vill make
bolognas, frankfurters, liebervurst, or any oder
kindt of sissage dot is alretty. Vot you dink of

<p>“Huh!” grunted Jupe aside, “ah’s seed lots ob
crazy inventors sense ah wourk hyah, but dis am
de fustest sausage machine inventor dot I ebber
clapped mah ole eyes on.” He stared at young
Dill as if he had been a natural curiosity of some
sort.</p>

<p>Jack bit his lip hard to keep from laughing. As
for Tom, he exploded into a roar of laughter
which he could not restrain. Young Dill looked
bewildered.</p>

<p>“I seel idt to you der Dill Convertible Sausage
Machine for fif’ dousandt tollars!” he exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
with the air of a person making an unheard-of
offer.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, Mr. Dill,” said Jack, with exemplary
gravity, “but we couldn’t handle your invention
if you made a much cheaper price on it.
However, you can no doubt dispose of it elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“Ugh! Yo’ alls better try er butcher shop,
Dutchy,” muttered Jupe, “an’ ef dey don’ want it
dere take it to a crazy house; maybe they kin use
it and yo’ alls, too.”</p>

<p>“Budt don’d you tink idt iss a goodt inventions?”
persisted young Dill.</p>

<p>“Excellent! Fine!” declared Jack, with a side
wink at Tom. “But we couldn’t handle it at all.
And now, Mr. Dill, we’ll have to say good morning.
We are very busy. I’m sorry for what happened,
but really you know you brought it partly
on yourself.”</p>

<p>“Himmel! oder you hadt bought idt my convertible
sissage machine I vould nodt haf cared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
if I hadt been drowned all over,” declared young
Dill.</p>

<p>With a melancholy face he gathered up his
little wicker satchel. The boys were turning
away when a sudden idea entered the young German’s
head. His face became irradiated with a
ray of hope.</p>

<p>“I haf idt here a motel of der convertible sissage
machine,” he said, “aber you dakes me py
der house I show you how to make bolognas,
frankfurters, lieber&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be of the least use, Mr. Dill, you’d
only be wasting your time,” said Jack. “Excuse
us now, please, we must hurry off.”</p>

<p>The young German was left standing alone on
the gravel walk in the midst of his rubicund puddle.
He looked after the retreating figures of
the two boys and Jupe with a melancholy countenance.
But he was gratified none the less to
observe that Jupe appeared to be getting what is
commonly known as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> “calling down.”</p>

<p>“So dey don’d vant idt der convertible sissage
machines,” he muttered. “Vell dey don’d know
dot dey let a fortune slip through dere fingers der
same as sissage slip through my machine, ain’d
idt.”</p>

<p>His eyes fixed themselves on Jupe’s humbled
figure.</p>

<p>“Chust der same,” he muttered in a low tone,
“midt vun handt I can lick you&mdash;nigger!”</p>

<p>Having done this justice to his outraged feelings,
young Dill wrung the water out of his coat-tails
and set out on the road to Nestorville. He
thought that he had seen the last of High Towers.
Had he but known it he was destined to do the
boys a singular service ere long, but as he trudged
along singing “Hi-lee! hi-lo!” to himself in a
melancholy voice he was totally unaware of this.</p>

<small>HANK AND MILES MEET THEIR MATCH.</small></h2>


<p>“Mr. Avery” and “Mr. Reynolds,” the names
by which Hank Nevins and Miles Sharkey had
chosen respectively to be known, were seated on
the porch of the Hinkley House taking their ease
with their feet elevated so as to afford a good
view of the soles of their boots to any passers-by,
when young Dill came down the street.</p>

<p>Having recovered from his first disappointment,
the young German, who came of a persevering
race, determined to remain in Nestorville
for a time at any rate and try to see the Boy Inventors
again, regarding the Convertible Sausage
Machine, at a more auspicious time. He had a
small sum of money saved up, quite sufficient for
his needs, and he resolved to buy some new
clothes at the first opportunity and then make
a more imposing descent upon High Towers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>As he rightly argued, his appearance that
morning had not been calculated to inspire confidence.</p>

<p>“Der great inventors, aber Eddy’s son, aber
Macaroni, der inventor of der hairless telegraph,
nefer fall py a pond midt a nigger,” he mused.
“Maype dose poys dink I am a faker. Aber I
don’d plame dem. I gedt idt me a new oudfit of
clothes undt den call aroundt again. ‘No trouble
to show goodts’ as de used to say idt ven I vos
in pisiness.”</p>

<p>This train of thought brought him as far as the
Hinkley House where our Teutonic friend bethought
him that after his strenuous exertions of
the morning some dinner would be the proper
thing.</p>

<p>“Dis looks idt like a goodt quiedt hotel, aindt
idt?” he said to himself. “I makes idt a pest
(guest) of meinself here, py chiminy.”</p>

<p>By some mischievous chance the odd figure of Mr.
Dill, rendered doubly striking since his immer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>sion,
caught the eye of Hank Nevins,&mdash;alias Mr.
Avery,&mdash;as he sat discussing, with his chum
Miles, the best means of carrying out their designs
against Ned Nevins and his Electric Monarch.</p>

<p>There was nothing that Hank liked better than
to tease some one who looked as if he might prove
an unresisting victim, and here was one ready to
his hand, at least so he judged.</p>

<p>“Hello, Dutchy,” he remarked amiably, “been
taking a bath with your clothes on?”</p>

<p>Young Dill faced round on him and looked him
over from top to toe.</p>

<p>“Aber I dink idt a bath do you no harm, mein
freindt, aindt idt,” he remarked blandly, “midt
or midoudt clothes on.”</p>

<p>This was not exactly what Hank had expected,
and a subdued chuckle from some hangers on
about the hotel porch did not increase his good
humor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>
<p>“It’s a good thing we didn’t cross on the same
boat,” observed Hank. “If I’d seen you I’d never
have landed.”</p>

<p>“So&mdash;&mdash;” observed young Dill amiably, “veel
dere vos no chance of your seeing me alretty.”</p>

<p>Hank winked at the loungers in order to show
them that he was now prepared to have some fun
with the queer-looking German youth.</p>

<p>“Is that so? How was that, Dutchy?” he asked
with a grin.</p>

<p>“Pecos I come on a <em>passenger</em> boat,” rejoined
young Dill with all the equanimity in the world.</p>

<p>A look of intense discomfiture spread over
Hank’s face.</p>

<p>“The Dutchman’s too much for him,” he heard
some one whisper. As might be expected this
remark did not tend to smooth over Hank’s feelings
toward the simple-looking young German.
Instead he determined to launch some shaft of
wit at him that would squash him flatter than a
pancake. But so far all his attempts had proved
boomerangs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose you know all about sausages?” he
asked.</p>

<p>Young Dill’s eyes glittered. Here was a subject
in which he was deeply interested.</p>

<p>“Oh ches!” he burst out eagerly, “sissages und&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never mind that, Sauerkraut,” sneered Hank.
“What kind of meat makes the best bologna?”</p>

<p>Young Dill, who was smart enough in his way,
saw that some joke was going to be had at his
expense if he did not look out. The loungers
leaned forward expectantly. Hank looked triumphant.
At last he thought he had the “Dutchman”
up a tree.</p>

<p>“You vant to know vot kindt of meat makes idt
pest bolognas?” he asked innocently.</p>

<p>“That’s what I said, Dutch,” grinned Hank.</p>

<p>“You ought to know dot aber bedder dan me alretty,”
said young Dill gravely.</p>

<p>“Is that so, old Sauerkraut? How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Pecos der pest bologna is made midt cal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>f’s
headt, undt you vos veel supplidt mid dot,”
drawled out young Dill, and without waiting to
hear the roar of laughter that went up at Hank’s
expense, he wandered into the office and registered.
His signature was a peculiar one. This
is how it read on the register:</p>

<p>“Herr Heiny Pumpernick Dill,&mdash;Inventor At
Large (and Small)&mdash;N. Y.”</p>

<p>After ascertaining what time dinner would be
ready, Herr Dill went to his room and busied
himself till the meal was served by tidying up as
well as he could, and removing the effects of his
immersion. In this he could not but admit that he
was not very successful, and he resolved immediately
after dinner to saunter out and see what
he could find in the way of smart attire in the
village.</p>

<p>“I vunder now if I couldt gedt idt some yellow
gloves,” mused young Dill to himself as he carefully
unpacked the model of the sausage machine
and placed it on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>“An inventor midt yellow gloves,&mdash;undt a redt
necktie vould be some class as an inventor. Aber
he vould be as stylish as Macaroni oder Eddy’s
son.”</p>

<p>He fussed over his invention for a while to
pass away the time till the dinner bell rang out its
summons. It was an odd-looking contrivance.
From a cylindrical steel box projected several
hooked steel arms manipulated with springs in a
way which no one but the inventor could by any
possibility have mastered.</p>

<p>While young Dill was working on one of these
arms, there came a sudden sharp snap and he
jerked his arm quickly out of the way and upwards.</p>

<p>“Himmel!” he exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> “dot machine makes

<small>READY FOR FLIGHT.</small></h2>


<p>“Well, fellows, the Electric Monarch is ready
for her trial trip at last.”</p>

<p>Thus spoke Jack Chadwick the following day.
The body of the great land and water craft, looking
like a butterfly with its wings off, stood, resplendent
in glittering paint and varnish, inside
the big construction shed.</p>

<p>All that remained to be done to fit her for the
air was to equip the framework with the wings
which were made detachable. This had been a
necessary modification of Jeptha Nevins’ plans,
as the shed in which the craft had been constructed
was not wide enough to permit the wings being
attached while the Electric Monarch was still
under cover.</p>

<p>At first this had proved quite a problem, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
with the aid of Professor Chadwick who, as has
been said, had taken an active part in the work,
the boys evolved a plan whereby the wings, (or
planes,) had been made detachable and could be
bolted or unbolted at pleasure. As the weight of
each plane did not exceed fifty pounds, despite its
broad spread, the work of putting on or taking off
the wings was a comparatively easy one.</p>

<p>It was an interested group that stood in the
shed and surveyed their completed work. The
Electric Monarch, they knew, was without question
the most unique craft of its kind that had
ever been constructed. Perfect in every detail
as the great craft was, the boys felt a thrill of
pride run through them as they viewed their completed
handiwork. Professor Chadwick had
spared no expense in aiding the boys at their
task and the result was as perfect a bit of mechanism
as had ever been assembled. Outside the
shed the great wings were ranged on special racks
ready for attachment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>To fit the Electric Monarch for flight all that
was required was the charging of her powerful
storage batteries. The craft would then be ready
for the crucial test which would prove whether
she was to live up to her name or be merely a
mass of expensive junk fit only for the scrap-pile.</p>

<p>It was small wonder then, that with the boys’
feeling of glad pride, there was mingled no little
anxiety. They stood on the threshold of either a
monumental triumph or an ignoble failure.</p>

<p>“Well, Ned,” said Jack, clapping their slender
young assistant on the shoulder, “there’s your
Electric Monarch as fit for flight as she ever will
be.”</p>

<p>Ned Nevins turned his large eyes gratefully
upon the boy he had learned within the past weeks
to love and respect.</p>

<p>“If she succeeds it will be owing to you, Jack,
and you, Tom,” he said happily;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> “as for Professor
Chadwick, I owe him a debt of gratitude I
can never repay.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, my lad,” spoke the Professor, with
a kindly smile, “win or lose, we have all learned
much during the last few weeks. Ned, your
uncle, had he lived, would have been one of the
world’s great inventive geniuses.”</p>

<p>“I know it. I am sure of it,” said Ned gratefully.
“My poor uncle! This would have been
a proud day for him if he had lived.”</p>

<p>He resolutely fought back his momentary feeling
of sadness, and in order to regain his composure
helped Jack adjust a brace and tighten one
or two bolts.</p>

<p>“An’ you alls means ter tell me widout confabulation
or fear ob controversial flabbergumbugism
dat dis yar monstrositfex am er gwine ter fly er
swim?” demanded Jupe, lapsing, as he always did
under excitement, into a perfect spasm of word
coining.</p>

<p>“We hope so, Jupe,” rejoined Tom. “Why, are
you aching for a ride?”</p>

<p>“Who, me?” and Jupe’s eyes grew wide.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> “No,
sah! Ah’m nuthin’ but jes er tumble-bug so far
as de desirousness ob cirperambulatin’ de air am
consarned.”</p>

<p>“So you wouldn’t care to go up, Jupe?” inquired
Ned, with a smile.</p>

<p>“No, sah! Wid emphaticness, ah says, N-O-No!
Ef dat ting eber fall frum de etarnal hebbins!&mdash;Laws-ee!
What a confabulating smashup
dere is agwine ter be aroun’ hyar.”</p>

<p>“But we don’t figure that it will fall, Jupe. At
any rate we are going to fly out over the water
and then the twin boats will keep us afloat whatever
happens.”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, sah, Massah Jack, be dat as it may,
I’d rabber be on der groun’ lookin’ up dan in der
sky lookin’ down,” declared the old negro with
great positiveness.</p>

<p>“Let us make a final trip of inspection,” suggested
the Professor. The idea was hailed gladly.
Led by Mr. Chadwick, the lads, laughing and
chatting gaily, went through the cabins and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
strong structure designed to support the Electric
Monarch when in flight.</p>

<p>The staterooms were finished with glittering
paint and everything was spick and span as a new
pin. Leaving the first cabin they passed through
the connecting tube into the other one. This having
been minutely examined, even down to the
electric stove with which it was provided, the professor
led the way into what was, to the boys, the
most interesting part of the craft.</p>

<p>This was the pilot house. It has been already
described, so we shall not go into any details
further than to say that every appliance was in
place, the wiring perfect, and all in readiness for
the pilot to take the wheel and guide the most
wonderful craft of the age on her initial flight.</p>

<p>Running fore-and-aft the entire length of the
Electric Monarch, was a narrow plank runway.
This was so that any part of the craft might be
reached with ease when she was under way. The
runway extended out to the bearings of the pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>pellers
already mentioned, and it would be part
of the duty of whoever was entrusted with the
oiling to venture out occasionally within reach of
the whirling blades and apply lubricants to the
bearings. On the water this would be a comparatively
simple matter. None of the boys was quite
sure in his mind just how this duty would appear
when the craft was many hundreds of feet
above the earth.</p>

<p>However, they were not worrying about such
details as this just then. There was but one
thought uppermost in the minds of each of the
eager young constructors of the Electric Monarch.</p>

<p>Would she live up to expectations?</p>

<p>Possibly Ned, who was new to aerial work, was
more nervous than his companions over the
thought of the trial trip. This was not surprising.
It requires courage of a rare sort to attempt for
the first time to climb the air in an absolutely untried
craft. Yet this was the ordeal they had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
face. Moreover, there was a strong possibility
that a failure might result in death.</p>

<p>“Have you decided yet upon the course we will
take on the trial trip?” Jack inquired of his father
as they finished their inspection, a tour, by the
way, on which Sam had not been invited, to his
great chagrin.</p>

<p>“Yes; if all goes well we will fly straight for
the ocean, provided it is calm. That will give us
a fine opportunity to test out the hydroplane devices.”</p>

<p>“I feel sure enough of success to plan a voyage
across the Atlantic,” declared Tom confidently.</p>

<p>“That would be a little bit premature, my boy,”
said the Professor, with a smile.</p>

<p>“But provided the Electric Monarch is all we
expect, wouldn’t it be feasible?”</p>

<p>“I see no reason why not,” responded Mr.
Chadwick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> “At any rate in the present state of
aeronautics, if the dream of a flight across the
ocean is to come true, it seems to me that the
Electric Monarch will be the first to make the adventurous
voyage.”</p>

<p>“Ned, you will be famous yet,” declared Jack.
“I can see the name of Ned Nevins in the Hall
of Fame.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Maybe you see it in de bottom ob de
deep blue sea,” sniffed Jupe sceptically. The old
negro had no love for air craft since his experiences
in the electric storm in Yucatan.</p>

<p>While the foregoing scene had been transpiring
at High Towers, a far different one had been
taking place at the Hinkley House. Having finished
his dinner, a meal at which he caused much
merriment by his odd antics and remarks, young
Dill had sauntered out in search of new apparel.
He had succeeded beyond his wildest hopes in
finding some striking attire. From the stock of
the village tailor he had selected a suit of green,
red and black check, originally made for some
amateur theatricals, a red waistcoat and a funny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
little blue hat with what he called a “rudder”
stuck on behind.</p>

<p>From the tailor shop, where he insisted on having
his packages wrapped up, young Dill passed
to the haberdashery where he invested in a startling
necktie and some radiant socks. Then, with
triumph in his eye, and with his purchases under
his arm, he retraced his way to the hotel.</p>

<p>“By chiminy,” he said to himself, as he hurried
along quite unconscious of the wondering
glances cast his way. “Py chiminy grickets, I
show dem vot style is, I bet you my life!”</p>

<p>The German youth went straight to his room
to change into his gorgeous raiment. He was
still in the midst of this task, every now and then
stealing a look at himself in the mirror, when his
attention was arrested by the sound of voices in
the next room.</p>

<p>The partitions in the Hinkley House were not
particularly thick, this being caused by the fact
that landlord Hinkley, being of an economical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
turn of mind, had partitioned off all his large
rooms into two apartments when he became the
proprietor of the hostelry.</p>

<p>As a consequence, conversations carried on in
even ordinary tones were plainly audible in the
adjoining rooms.</p>

<p>“Py chiminy, I hope dose fellers in der next
room don’d talk it py dere schleep,” mused young
Dill as he tied his rainbow cravat, “or I get no
schlumbers, ain’d idt?”</p>

<p>The next instant his attention; was attracted
to the speakers in the adjoining room by a singular
circumstance. It appeared that he himself
was the topic of their conversation.</p>

<p>“That pig-headed Dutchman with the comedy
clothes,” was what he heard.</p>

<p>“Py chiminy, dot means me!” exclaimed
young Dill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> “der vind vos in somedings. Dere
vos a voodpile in der nigger in dot next room. I
dink I listen me a leedle closer, ain’d idt?”</p>

<small>HEINY OVERHEARS THE PLOT.</small></h2>


<p>Now, as my readers have no doubt seen by this
time, Heiny Pumpernick Dill was no fool. In
fact, despite his eccentric outside, the German
youth possessed a keen, smart mind, which acted
well in almost any emergency.</p>

<p>Giving a final flourish and grimace at himself
in token of admiration of his new necktie, young
Dill crept silently across the room and laid his
ear against the partition. In this position he
could hear every word that was being said in the
next room.</p>

<p>“So you know that the Dutchman was at High
Towers this morning?” said one of the voices,
that of Miles Sharkey, although, of course, young
Dill could not recognize it.</p>

<p>But he recognized the voice that replied without
hesitation:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I made it my business to find out about
the sauerkraut-eating Heiny,” was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Ah-ha! Now comes it oudt!” exclaimed
young Dill to himself. “Dot is der feller vot
dinks he get funny midt me and laughs midt der
wrong side of his face yet.”</p>

<p>“Is he a friend of that High Towers bunch?”</p>

<p>The voice that was unfamiliar to the German
youth put the question.</p>

<p>“Aber am I ein friendt or not?” muttered
young Dill. “I vould like to know dot.”</p>

<p>“No, he’s no friend,” it was Hank speaking,
“in fact, from what I hear, he got into a row of
some sort up there to-day.”</p>

<p>“Aber dot’s right, budt idt vos in der lake vot
I gedt,” said young Dill to himself.</p>

<p>“So he is not one of the crowd at all?”</p>

<p>“No. He’s just a butter-in of some sort. I
hear they get a lot of cranks up there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! So I’m a ker-ank, am I?” muttered
the German boy, shaking his fist at the uncon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>scious
pair in the next room. “You vatch me! I
bedt you my life some day I ker-ank you der
wrong vay, mein freindt.”</p>

<p>“Well, crank or no crank, he certainly put it
over on you before dinner to-day, Hank. I’d advise
you to leave him alone in future.”</p>

<p>“So his name vos Hank,” murmured young
Dill, as he listened. “All righd, Hank, you gedt
fixed by a ker-ank&mdash;by chiminy, dot’s boetry de
firstest vot I ever make!” exclaimed the lad, as
he formed the involuntary rhyme.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll fix him, never fear,” rejoined Hank.
“The tallow-headed buttinski! But first we’ve
got other things to attend to. The Dutchman can
wait.”</p>

<p>“You chust bedt he can vait, Mister Hank,”
muttered Heiny, on his side of the partition,
“vaiting is one of der best things he does, und
ven he gedts idt goodt undt retty den he yump&mdash;by
chiminy!&mdash;he yump!”</p>

<p>“That’s right, we had better discuss what we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
mean to do. If they make that trial trip to-morrow
we shall have to act quickly,” said Miles in
reply to Hank’s last remark.</p>

<p>“What did you find out?” he added.</p>

<p>“Well, I spent quite a bit of time snooping
around up there. I found a fool of a colored man
who told me a lot.”</p>

<p>“Dot vos der plack feller, I bedt you my life,”
chuckled the German boy, with his ear to the partition.
“Veil he <em>iss</em> a chump und dot’s der first
true word der feller in der next room has
spoken.”</p>

<p>“So the colored man was easy, eh?”</p>

<p>“Easy? I should say. I told him I was from
Edison’s place and was just looking around. He
didn’t loosen up much so I gave him a dollar and
he told me all he knew. He’s a bigger chump
than that Dutch kid.”</p>

<p>“So-o-o-o!” fairly hissed Heiny, on his side of
the wall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> “veel, Mister Schmardty, maype dot der
Tutch poy is not so much of chump as you
dink.”</p>

<p>“Well, what did he tell you?” demanded Miles
impatiently.</p>

<p>“About all I wanted to know. I posed as being
interested in young Nevins, but not wanting him
to know that I was around till the success or failure
of the Electric Hydroaeroplane was assured.”</p>

<p>“Now comes it oudt,” muttered Heiny, pricking
up his ears.</p>

<p>“Yes, and then&mdash;upon my word you are slow.
Hank,” came Miles’s voice.</p>

<p>“Humph! that’s all the thanks I get after all
the work I’ve done,” came in an aggrieved voice
from Hank.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Hank. Of course I know
you’ve done well. But get down to cases.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” continued Hank in a sulky tone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
“I learned that the Electric Monarch is completed.
The trial trip will probably take place to-morrow
morning, or it may be delayed till night. If we
mean to strike, we must do so quickly.”</p>

<p>“Yes, if we can’t get hold of the plans we must
do all we can to cripple the ship, for if once it is
a proved success, our game is up.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Confound that young cousin of
mine. He’s checkmated me.”</p>

<p>“Not quite yet, Hank,” was the confident reply.
“Even if we don’t get a chance to injure the ship
or steal the plans, I’ve yet another scheme up my
sleeve&mdash;a legal one.”</p>

<p>“A legal one?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m smart enough for that. But we
won’t work it till the time comes. In the meanwhile
we must do what we can to stop this trial
trip from coming off.”</p>

<p>“Have you any plans in that respect?”</p>

<p>“No, I confess I hadn’t till you told me about
that Dutch boy. Why can’t we use him?”</p>

<p>“What, that dunderhead!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah-ha! So-o-o-o I am a dunderhead, too, iss
idt?” growled Heiny from his side of the partition.
“I’m dunderheadt midt ears on my dunderheadt,
though, py chiminys!”</p>

<p>He started counting on his pudgy fingers.</p>

<p>“Chump! Dutchman! Dunderheadt! Dot
makes three! Very veel, Hank, I makes it all
ger-skvare midt you before I gedts drough, I bet
me.”</p>

<p>“Of course he’s a bonehead,” came the other
voice, which made poor Heiny squirm.</p>

<p>“But that’s all the better for our purpose. If
he had any sense he might suspect something.
As it is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He don’d know somedings,” chuckled Heiny
to himself.</p>

<p>“Hanged if I can see what you are driving at,”
growled Hank. “I wouldn’t employ that Dutchman
to mop off a floor.”</p>

<p>“Of you did I mop idt midt you,” muttered the
young German indignantly.</p>

<p>“Now, listen, Hank,” said Miles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> “the German
got into trouble up there to-day, you say? Very
well, he’s naturally sore at the whole High Towers
crowd. All right. We go to him and offer
him a chance to get even. Nobody would suspect
him of contemplating any harm to anything
or anybody; he hasn’t got sense enough.”</p>

<p>“Py golly, I premeditate harm to you all righdt,
mister,” grunted young Dill angrily.</p>

<p>“What do you mean to get him to do?” inquired
Hank eagerly.</p>

<p>“We’ll discuss that later. The thing to do now
is to get him on our side.”</p>

<p>“I’ll attend to that,” said Hank, “leave it to me
to fix that Dutchman so that he’ll eat out of my
hand.”</p>

<p>“Vell now dot is nice of you,” said young Dill
to himself as the two men in the next room vacated
it, closing the door behind them.</p>

<small>THE BURGLAR TRAP.</small></h2>


<p>The German lad finished his preparations for
astonishing Nestorville with elaborate care.
Having adjusted his derby at what he considered
a fetching angle, he prepared to descend and to
conquer.</p>

<p>“Maype so I cotch idt an heiress,” he said to
himself, “undt den I bodder no more midt der
convertible sissage machine.”</p>

<p>Heiny was perfectly right when he concluded
that he was about to astonish Nestorville. The
porch of the hotel was fairly well occupied when
he descended, and the street was also pretty well
thronged. The sight of the German youth in
his tight-fitting check clothes, gaudy socks, rainbow
tie and yellow gloves created an amount of
attention which gratified Heiny to the full.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>“For der first time dey see idt in dis penighted
village vot clothes vears a chentleman,” he said
to himself.</p>

<p>His first jar came when a small boy stepped
up to him.</p>

<p>“Say, mister?” said the urchin.</p>

<p>“Vel, vot idt iss, mein poy?” asked Heiny.</p>

<p>“Wot cher sellin’?”</p>

<p>“Sellin’? I do not comprehension you.”</p>

<p>“What you advertisin’ then. Squirts Savory
Soap or Odles Orient Oats?”</p>

<p>“Mein leedle poy, I adtvertise idt nuddings.”</p>

<p>“Nor sell nothing?”</p>

<p>“Nein. I am a chentleman of leisure undt an
inventor.”</p>

<p>“Oh, climb back in der cage,” advised the rude
urchin, and amidst a shout of laughter from his
cronies he dashed off.</p>

<p>“Climb py der cage?” muttered young Dill,
looking about.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> “I see no cage, undt efen if I didt
I vouldn’t climb in&mdash;no, sir, not vile I haf nice
room midt conversationings thrown in free of
charge for nuddings.”</p>

<p>“On a trip?” asked a tall gangling village youth
of the “half-baked” age, approaching the German
boy.</p>

<p>“No, I am oudt on der ocean sufferin’ seferely
midt sea sickness,” responded Heiny with withering
scorn, and the village youth subsided.</p>

<p>“I vonder vot is der madder midt me?” thought
young Dill to himself, seeing that he was the
observed of all observers in and about the hotel.
“Oh, vell! I subbose dot a vell-dressed man is
not often seen hereabouts.”</p>

<p>He sat down in a chair on the porch and before
long a cadaverous-looking individual, with lank,
black hair and a solemn countenance seated himself
beside him.</p>

<p>“A stranger in our city, sir, I take it?” began
the newcomer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>
<p>“Yes, dey all seem to dink I am stranger dan
anydings dot dey see yet,” rejoined Heiny good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“A natural ignorance, my dear sir. You, I
take it, come from the centers of cosmopolitanism?”</p>

<p>“Vell, I don’t know dot town. I come from
New York,” was the German youth’s reply.</p>

<p>“A noble city, sir.”</p>

<p>“Vell, I don’d know about dot. Dey vouldn’d
buy mein convertible sissage machine.”</p>

<p>“What, you are an inventor?”</p>

<p>“Ches, an inventor at large&mdash;(undt schmall)&mdash;&mdash;”
declared young Dill, throwing out his chest
proudly.</p>

<p>“You must make a great deal of money.”</p>

<p>“Oh, enough to lif py meinself&mdash;enough for
dot! I don’d vant for nuddings. Der best in
clothes or foodt is none too goodt for me,” and
the German swelled with pride. He did not notice
the glitter that had come into the eyes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
cadaverous man at the mention of money. He
eyed young Dill cunningly and then asked:</p>

<p>“A guest of this hotel, sir?”</p>

<p>“Ches, I stop here. Idt iss nodt a badt blace
but der pickles iss no good,” said young Dill
loftily, as if he had been used to hotels all his
life.</p>

<p>The cadaverous man leaned over toward the
German youth confidentially.</p>

<p>“If you carry large sums with you I need not
warn you of the danger of thieves.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I am careful midt mein money,”
young Dill assured his new-found friend, “I alvays
schleep midt idt in der toe of vun of mein
shoes,”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed. May I ask why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>“Vell, you see, ker-ooks dey look under der
pillow undt in der clothing but dey nefer dink of
lookin’ py der toes of mein shoes. A goodt
scheme, ain’d idt?”</p>

<p>“Excellent. Good evening, my dear young
man. I have much enjoyed our conversation.”</p>

<p>And the cadaverous-looking man bowed himself
out, looking back as he went with a covert
smile on his face.</p>

<p>“Thank you, my Teutonic friend,” he said to
himself as he made his way across the office.
“I’m much obliged to you for confiding to ‘Deacon’
Terry the place where you hide your roll.
To judge by your clothes it must be a fat one.
I think I’ll investigate your shoes to-night.”</p>

<p>So thinking, “Deacon” Terry, the notorious
hotel thief, examined the register, made sure of
the location of “the inventor’s” room and then
politely requested that his baggage be transferred
to a room on that floor, as the room he had been
assigned to did not please him. His request was
at once granted, for the “Deacon” possessed an
impressive, not to say ministerial manner, which
gave not the least clue to his real character.</p>

<p>Without appearing to feel the slightest con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>cern
in them, young Dill watched, with intense interest,
the movements of Hank Nevins and
Miles Sharkey, following the conclusion of the
evening meal. Matters were further complicated
in the German youth’s mind by the fact that they
did not approach him, as he had expected, but instead,
engaged the landlord’s son in conversation.</p>

<p>By adroitly maneuvering, young Dill succeeded
in getting into a position where a pillar in the
lobby hid him from view and afforded a capital
screen behind which to listen to the formation of
the plot which he was sure was going forward.
He had learned earlier in the day that Sam Hinkley
worked at the High Towers workshop and
was considerably surprised when he saw the boy
allow himself to be drawn into talk with Hank
and the man the German youth knew as “Der
stranger.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bedt idt er pretzel dot der iss some more
crooked pisiness going forvarts,” he thought to
himself as he watched Sam in deep conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
with the pair he already knew plotted mischief to
the Electric Monarch. “Does two fellers iss so
crooked dey could behind a corkscrew hide. I
vatch undt lisden. Maybe I find idt oudt some
more. If I do, I tell der poys by der Electric
Monarch and den maybe dey give me a chob.”</p>

<p>With this idea in mind, he worked his way to
the position he adjudged most favorable for his
eavesdropping. Now young Dill was no friend
to sneaky ways, but in the present case he felt
that the end justified almost any means. He
knew enough to realize that the Boy Inventors’
project was threatened by two men whom he instinctively
felt were bad characters, even if he
had not overheard their talk of the afternoon.</p>

<p>He had not listened long when all his suspicions
were confirmed. With cunning skill
Miles Sharkey was working on Sam Hinkley’s
hatred of Ned Nevins to enlist Sam in the plot
against the Electric Monarch. But to young
Dill’s chagrin, he could not get close enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
hear all their conversation without risking being
discovered. He had, therefore, to content himself
with fragmentary bits. But such as these
were, they were quite sufficient to inform him that
Sam Hinkley was ready to turn traitor to his
young employers.</p>

<p>“Then you’ll do it?” were the last words the
German youth heard Miles address to Sam
Hinkley.</p>

<p>“You can depend on me to fix the young
sneak,” he heard Sam answer. “But when do I
get my money?”</p>

<p>“When we get ours from the party I told you
about. Is that satisfactory?” asked Miles, who
appeared to act as spokesman.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” was Sam’s reply, as he
strolled away, and the two conspirators exchanged
triumphant glances.</p>

<p>“Now dey come py me, I bedt you my life,”
muttered the young German to himself as he
flopped into a chair and appeared engrossed in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
newspaper which happened, by good luck, to be
lying there. Sure enough it was not many minutes
before he heard a honey voice addressing
him.</p>

<p>It was Hank. He expressed great regret for
the occurrences of the morning.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what got into me,” he said, “anyhow
I apologize very sincerely.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dot’s all righdt,” said young Dill easily,
“und at dot I don’d dink dot you hadt very much
on me.”</p>

<p>Hank agreed, and then after some more conversation
he approached the subject that young
Dill knew he had been leading up to all the time.</p>

<p>“You know those Boy Inventors, as they call
them, up at High Towers?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Vell, I can’t say dot I know dem,” replied
Heiny truthfully, “but I like to get a chob by
dem.”</p>

<p>“Oh, looking for a job, are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ches, I needt some money preddy badtly und
I don’d mindt telling you dot I aindt particular
how I get idt alretty.”</p>

<p>Hank fell into the trap readily. “This fellow’s
easier than I thought,” he chuckled to himself.
He proceeded to “feel out” the German youth a
little more, and then made him a confidant in their
plans, young Dill appearing to fall in readily with
all their schemes.</p>

<p>Briefly the plot was this. Young Dill was to
present himself at High Towers in the morning.
Seemingly he was to be in quest of work. But
his real mission was to take advantage of any opportunity
that might present itself to disconnect
one of the wires leading from the storage batteries
to the motor. Failing in this, he was to injure
the Electric Monarch in any way that he
could, Hank having previously found out that
young Dill understood considerable about machinery.</p>

<p>To all this the young German appeared to
agree. In fact he was even enthusiastic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess I make more money on dis chob dan I
vouldt oudt of mein sissage machine,” he said.</p>

<p>“Money!” exclaimed Hank. “Why, if you can
pull this thing off right you’ll be able to buy a new
suit every ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“Den I’m your man,” said young Dill.</p>

<p>Soon after this he went to bed. He would
have liked to go to High Towers that night but
he knew that he was watched. Moreover, as
there was to be no attempt made to injure the machine
till the next morning, he would not have
accomplished any useful purpose, except perhaps,
to scare the plotters away, which was the last
thing he wished to do.</p>

<p>Before turning in, the German youth expended
a few loving caresses on the convertible sausage
machine, and then, placing it on the floor, he tumbled
into bed and soon his snores proclaimed that
at least one guest of the Hinkley House was enjoying
peaceful slumber.</p>

<p>It was after midnight that a door down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
corridor from the German youth’s room was cautiously
opened and the cadaverous head and lank
black locks of “Deacon” Terry protruded themselves
into the dimly lighted passage. Apparently
satisfied that every one was in bed, the “Deacon”
slipped out of his room and tip-toed down
the passage to young Dill’s door.</p>

<p>Bending, he listened at the key-hole. The nasal
music which greeted his ears caused a satisfied
smile to creep over his features. He fumbled
in his pocket for a minute and then a jingling
sound proclaimed that he had found what he was
in search of&mdash;a bunch of skeleton keys.</p>

<p>With a deftness born of long practice the
“Deacon” inserted one of the keys in the lock of
young Dill’s door. There was the slightest of
clicks and then the Deacon cautiously pushed the
portal open. An instant’s pause, and then with
the gliding motion of a snake, he slipped through
the door.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>
<p>“Snap!”</p>

<p>A sound like the firing of a pistol was followed
almost immediately by a most appalling yell.</p>

<p>“Help! Ouch! Help!”</p>

<p>The next moment a figure came flying into the
corridor. Attached to it was what at first sight
appeared to be a gigantic spider. Down the corridor
the figure fled, yelling at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>All through the hotel, doors could be heard
opening and shouts and cries rang through the
entire structure from office to garret!</p>

<p>“It’s fire!”</p>

<p>“There’s murder!”</p>

<p>“Call the police!”</p>

<p>“Thieves!”</p>

<p>“Fire! Fire!”</p>

<p>Mingling with these and a dozen other frantic
cries from alarmed guests came the clanging of
gongs as the night clerk, aroused from his doze
in the office, sprang to the emergency alarm and
pulled it. This redoubled the confusion.</p>

<p>In the midst of the pandemonium there came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
skyrocketing madly down the stairs into the half-dressed
crowd swarming in the lobby, an extraordinary
and alarming figure. It was that of a man
clad only in shirt and trousers upon whose face
was stamped the wildest terror. Frightened cries
broke from his lips and the horrified onlookers
perceived that, attached to him, behind, was a
gigantic spider, or such at least the thing appeared.</p>

<p>With a last frantic cry the victim of the repulsive-looking
creature gave a bound and fell headlong
on the floor of the crowded lobby. As he
did so there was a metallic clang, the “spider”
was detached from his waistband and the excited
crowd saw that it was in reality a metallic device
of some sort.</p>

<p>It was just at this moment that the fire department
and the police department, the latter consisting
of two men and a chief, with a resplendent
star of pie-plate proportions, burst into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
thronged lobby. The chief rushed up to the prostrate
man and raised him to his feet.</p>

<p>The instant his eyes encountered the other’s
face, the village functionary gave a cry of astonishment.</p>

<p>“It’s ‘Deacon’ Terry, the crook!” he exclaimed,
with a firm grip on the man. “There’s a description
and a reward out for his capture.”</p>

<p>“What have you been up to now?” asked one
of the policemen, but before the discomfited thief
could reply, a strange figure in red and white
striped pajamas shoved its way through the excited
throng that jammed the lobby.</p>

<p>“I can tell you dot. Dot feller dere vos try to
make a robberies midt mein room. Mein burglar
trap&mdash;dot used to be a sissage machine&mdash;makes a
capture by him.”</p>

<p>“Who in thunder are you?” demanded the
chief, regarding the wild-looking German youth
with amazement.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>
<p>“I am Heiny Pumpernick Dill, inventor at
large (undt schmall) of der Convertible Sissage
Machine. Dot iss, idt used to be a sissage machine&mdash;now
I make idt of him a burglar trap.”</p>

<p>“Say, is this fellow crazy or what?” exclaimed
the chief, who had been unable, not unnaturally,
to make head or tail of this jargon.</p>

<p>“I think I can explain, chief,” said the night
clerk, coming forward. “It’s plain enough that
this fellow,&mdash;the ‘Deacon’ as you call him,&mdash;tried
to get into Mr. Dill’s room. He succeeded,
but instead of robbing Dill he was seized by this
what-you-may-call it.”</p>

<p>He indicated the sausage machine lying in a
heap of spider-like limbs and springs on the floor
near-by.</p>

<p>“Dot is not a what-you-mighdt-call-idt&mdash;&mdash;”
began young Dill indignantly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> “idt is a sissage
machine. I pudt him der door py ven I go to
mein schleep. I suppose dot dis feller got ger-grabbed
by idt ven he come to take all der money
dot I told him early in der efenin’ I hadt in mein
shoes.”</p>

<p>It was some time before things quieted down
and the notorious “Deacon” was taken off to the
village lock-up. Young Dill was the recipient of
many congratulations on the success of his
“burglar-trap.” But somehow they did not
please him. As he returned to his interrupted
slumbers he muttered to himself:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>
<p>“I am a preddy bum inventor alretty. I don’d
know meinself vot I invent. Here I go to vurk
undt make idt a fine sissage machine undt now I
haf to turn idt into a burglar-trap&mdash;Himmel!”</p>

<small>THE LOST LEVER.</small></h2>


<p>Bright and early the next morning the young
inventors, and the workmen attached to their
“plant,” wheeled out the framework of the Electric
Monarch and the business of attaching the
wings was begun. It was just half an hour from
the time the work began to the moment when the
last bolt was in place, and like a huge red and silver
butterfly the wonderful craft stood poised
ready for flight.</p>

<p>The boys had had but little sleep and their
dreams had been of skimming the air or gliding
over the surface of the sea. Now, as they stood
back and gazed at their completed handiwork,
they felt a proud thrill of work well done. Come
what might of the trial trip, they felt that they
had done their very best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>Only one thing marred their delight at the completion
of their long task. Professor Chadwick,
who from time to time suffered from severe headaches,
would be unable to accompany them on the
initial voyage. Instead, one of the workmen, a
man named Joyce, was selected to go along.</p>

<p>When everything was in readiness for the
start, Jack visited his father’s study. He was in
hopes that even at the eleventh hour the Professor
might feel well enough to accompany them. He
well knew what a disappointment it was to his
father to have to remain behind. But Professor
Chadwick had been warned by his physician not
to risk excitement when suffering from one of his
nervous headaches.</p>

<p>Jack found his father lying on a lounge in the
library.</p>

<p>“No, Jack, my boy,” he said in answer to the
boy’s anxious inquiries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> “I’m afraid the trial trip
must be made without me. I am under doctor’s
orders and cannot disobey them.”</p>

<p>“I wish you could come, father,” replied the
boy, “but if everything goes off all right you will
have many opportunities to ride in the Electric
Monarch. Now, since you can’t come, I am going
to entrust to your care the plans and blue prints
of the craft.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they will be safer here.”</p>

<p>“I have just brought them from the workshop.
See, here they are,” and Jack produced a voluminous
roll of papers. “We are responsible to Ned
Nevins for the safety of these and we must see
that they are looked after carefully.”</p>

<p>“Put them in the safe, my boy, and then give
me the combination. If I feel better later on I
should like to look them over.”</p>

<p>Jack went to a large wall safe in one corner of
the room, opened it and placed the papers within.
He then gave the combination to his father on a
slip of paper. When this had been done he felt
easier in his mind.</p>

<p>“They are safe enough now,” he thought. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
mixed his father a draught of medicine and then,
summoning a servant, he told her to be ready to
answer any call from the library, in which room
Professor Chadwick intended to spend the day.</p>

<p>When this had been done Jack felt that further
delay would be useless. Bidding his father good-bye,
and promising to give him every detail of
the trip on his return, the boy hurried out to join
his comrades.</p>

<p>It was a cloudless day. There was not a
breath of wind to stir the leaves. A better morning
for the testing of the Electric Monarch could
not have been imagined.</p>

<p>“Well, Tom, we’re all ready, I guess.”</p>

<p>“As ready as we ever will be, Jack. The big
moment is due. Everything all right to your
mind, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Down to the last nut on the last bolt,” replied
young Nevins positively.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>
<p>“Then we had better climb on board and get
ready for the start.”</p>

<p>Joyce, a stalwart, middle-aged mechanic, followed
the boys on board the Electric Monarch.
They first visited the pilot house. It had already
been decided that Jack, on account of his
previous experience with aerial craft, was to
have the wheel. He gave a last look over the
equipment. The next instant he uttered an exclamation
of dismay.</p>

<p>“The landing lever is gone!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What!” the cry came from all three of his
companions simultaneously.</p>

<p>“It’s gone!” cried the boy. “Look here, it’s
been unbolted from the sector. Boys, the trial
trip is off if we can’t find it.”</p>

<p>As it was the landing lever that controlled the
descending impetus of the craft, it can readily be
seen that it would have been foolhardy&mdash;suicidal,
in fact&mdash;to have attempted to start without it.</p>

<p>“It was here the last thing last night,” cried
Ned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> “I know because I looked the whole craft
over before I turned in.”</p>

<p>“Just the same, it is gone,” declared Tom.</p>

<p>“Somebody has taken it,” struck in Joyce.</p>

<p>“Yes, somebody with a spite against us,” added
Ned, and in his mind the thought of Sam Hinkley
flashed up.</p>

<p>“Has anybody seen Sam about this morning?”
he asked.</p>

<p>No, nobody had. The boy had not put in his
usual appearance, which seemed odd, for recently
he had appeared to take more interest than usual
in the Electric Monarch.</p>

<p>“You surely don’t suspect&mdash;&mdash;” began Tom.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to say,” interrupted Jack,
“it looks odd, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“But what object could he have had in taking
it?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Better ask Ned that,” was the response. “He
told Ned he’d get even with him some time for
giving him a lesson on the porch of the Hinkley
House.”</p>

<p>“Well, suspicions won’t find that lever,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Ned. “Suppose we look for it. Let’s start a
hunt.”</p>

<p>“Not much use,” declared Joyce. “Whoever
took that lever has hidden it where we can’t find
it.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s so,” admitted Jack ruefully.
“I don’t want to accuse any one till we know, but
it looks as if&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A shout from beside the ship interrupted him.
It was Jupe. He was pointing down the hill.</p>

<p>“Gollyumption!” shouted the old negro, who
had been an interested though inactive onlooker.
“Hyar comes dat crazy Dutch kid!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, up the hill was coming, as fast
as his pudgy legs would carry him, the rotund
form of the doughty inventor of the convertible
sausage machine.</p>

<p>“Bother him. We don’t want that pest around
now. Hullo! what’s the matter with him?”</p>

<p>For young Dill was waving his arms like a
windmill. He dashed up, puffing like a locomo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>tive,
the next minute. It was plain he was wildly
excited about something. But for some seconds
he could only puff and gesticulate while his
eyes rolled as if he had eaten something that had
disagreed with him.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, are you sick?” asked Jack,
looking down from the pilot house.</p>

<p>“Aber-poof&mdash;Poys! You haf missed idt somedings&mdash;poof&mdash;from
der&mdash;sheeps?”</p>

<p>“Sheeps?” exclaimed Tom, puzzled.</p>

<p>“He means ship,” exclaimed Jack. “Say, fellows,
he knows something about the missing
lever. Is that it, Heiny?”</p>

<p>“Ches. Der liver of der sheep iss gone, ain’d
idt?”</p>

<p>“It certainly has. Do you know anything
about it?”</p>

<p>By this time Heiny had recovered his breath.
In a torrent of speech that nothing could stop
he rattled off the story of the overheard conversation,
of Sam’s treachery and of the way in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
which he had seemingly fallen in with the conspirators’
plans. Early that morning he had got
out of bed and tracked Sam Hinkley to High
Towers. He had watched while the treacherous
youth had unscrewed the lever and then had followed
him through the fields to an abandoned
well into which the rascally boy had thrown it.
During his narrative, Heiny gave a good description
of Hank Nevins and Miles Sharkey,
from which Ned had no difficulty in identifying
the plotters. The manner in which they had discovered
his whereabouts, though, was, of course,
a mystery to the lad.</p>

<p>But there was no time to waste just then in
discussing the best means of ensuring the punishment
of the conspirators. The main desire of all
the boys was to get back the lever and be off on
the interrupted test. Under young Dill’s guidance
the old well was soon found. It was almost filled
up with rubbish and it was an easy matter to get
the lever out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know how we can reward you for this
service,” Jack said to young Dill as they made
their way back to the Electric Monarch.</p>

<p>“Dere is an easy vay to do dot,” said the young
German, with the air of one who already has his
mind made up.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Make me der mashed shot of der Elegdrig
Monarch.”</p>

<p>“The what?” Jack regarded the lad with a puzzled
look. Young Dill had certainly done them a
splendid service and Jack, as they all did, wished
to reward him for it in some substantial way.</p>

<p>“Der mashed shot&mdash;der goot luck&mdash;der&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, the mascot!” cried Jack.</p>

<p>“Dot’s idt. I make idt a fine mashed shot. I
am strong. I am villing. I am an inventor, at
large (undt schmall) und&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But just what are the duties of a mascot? If
I make you one I’d like to be sure you understand
them,” said Jack with a wink at his companions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, dot vos easy. Der dooties of a mashed
shot are to sit in a corner undt keep making a
noise like a rabbid’s foot oder a horse’s-boot.”</p>

<p>“Horseshoe, I guess you mean. However, you
seem to have a pretty good idea of the job and we
can use you, anyhow, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Den I gedt der chob?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are one of the crew of the Electric
Monarch.”</p>

<p>“Hoch! Der Monarch!” shouted Heiny Dill,
throwing his funny little “rudder” hat high in the
air, “ven do vee start?”</p>

<p>“Thanks to your clever detective work, right
away.”</p>

<small>OFF AT LAST!</small></h2>


<p>The frame of the Electric Monarch thrilled to
the first impulse of her powerful motors. But
that thrill was nothing to the sense of suppressed
excitement that ran through the boys’ veins as
Jack, with throbbing pulses, set the lever that sent
the electric current into the driving machinery.</p>

<p>Outwardly calm, every person on board stood
at his station waiting the word for the start.
Tom Jesson was in the bow, Joyce, oil can in
hand, was at the stern. Ned Nevins, pale but
keeping a firm grip on his nerves, stood by the
motors. His “big moment” had come at last.
The dream of Jeptha Nevins was to be put to the
test.</p>

<p>Heiny Dill had had a special office created for
him at the last moment. He was, in addition to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
his self-conferred title of mascot, the “chief cook
and bottle washer”&mdash;in other words, the steward
of the Electric Monarch. He felt the responsibilities
of his office to the full as he stood with his
rotund face stuck out of the port cabin window
waiting for the start. He already had the electric
stove going and a big kettle of boiling water
on it. Just why, he could not have said, but he
felt that it was in line with his responsible position
to be doing something.</p>

<p>“Hold tight, everybody. We’re going up!”</p>

<p>The shout from the pilot house was like a bugle
call. Each boy involuntarily straightened up at
his post. The propellers beat the air faster and
faster. On the “bridge deck” the boys held
tightly to their caps. It was like being in a hurricane.
The mighty power of the motors made a
roaring noise, like the voice of a cataract. The
craft shook from stem to stern like a live thing
struggling against captivity.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a jerk and a yell from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Heiny as, amidst a crashing of pots and pans, he
was flung to the floor. On the “bridge deck” the
crew hung on tight. Their faces showed the
tense strain as Jack applied full power.</p>

<p>Off like an arrow from a bow shot the great
craft across the smooth slope leading down to
the lake. The speed was terrific. The craft
pitched and swayed so that it was only by holding
on for dear life that the boys could keep their
feet.</p>

<p>“Ledt me oudt! Ledt me oudt!” shrieked
Heiny, from amidst the wreckage of his cooking
utensils. “I don’d vant to be a mashed shot!”</p>

<p>“Gracious, if we don’t rise in a second we’ll be
in the lake!” cried Tom in dismay, but above the
roaring of the motors and propellers no one heard
him. But the same thought was in the minds of
all. Ned, white as ashes, peered straight ahead
as the massive craft dashed down the hill. Were
all their hopes doomed to disaster, after all?</p>

<p>In the pilot house Jack saw the impending dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>aster.
He threw his entire weight against the
lever that set the wings at a rising inclination.
The device was new and stiff. His most strenuous
exertions failed to move it.</p>

<p>He heard a voice at his shoulder. It was Ned
Nevins. He had guessed that something was
the matter and had clawed his way into the pilot
house down the pitching, swaying bridge.</p>

<p>“The rising lever! Quick!” he cried.</p>

<p>“I can’t move it. It’s stuck!” shouted back
Jack.</p>

<p>Ned braced his foot against the sector and both
boys threw the last ounce of their strength into
making the refractory bit of machinery move. It
did, with a suddenness that threw them both to
the floor of the pilot house.</p>

<p>But the next instant they gave a glad shout of
delight which echoed from one end of the craft to
the other.</p>

<p>The Electric Monarch was rising, shooting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
straight upward toward the blue heavens at tremendous
speed!</p>

<p>Jack scrambled to his feet like a shot. For one
instant the Electric Monarch was shooting skyward
without a guiding hand at the wheel. The
next moment her young skipper, with a firm
grasp of the spokes, was directing her course due
eastward toward the ocean.</p>

<p>While he did this, Ned set to work with oil can
and file on the lever which had so nearly caused
disaster. He soon had it fixed and had taken to
heart a lesson which had for its text, “It’s the little
things that count.”</p>

<p>“Gracious,” he said to Jack, as they shot
straight onward at a height the barograph
showed to be 2,500 feet, “that lever came near
wrecking us.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that now,” was the response,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
“just see how splendidly she is behaving. Ned,
old boy, the Electric Monarch is a success. A
bigger success than we dared to hope.”</p>

<p>“She is indeed,” said Ned, almost reverentially,
as he glanced down from the pilot house window
at the landscape flying by far below them. It
was his first experience in the air and he felt just
a bit creepy and scared.</p>

<p>But that feeling soon wore off, and before a
glittering expanse of water in the distance
showed them that the ocean lay before them, Ned
Nevins, the virtual owner of the Electric Monarch,
was at work on the motors, oiling and adjusting
as if he had been an engineer of a flying
ship all his life.</p>

<p>The motion of the craft was delightfully
smooth and even. If it had not been for the furious
wind of the propellers, and the roaring of the
motor, it would have been difficult to believe they
were moving at all. Yet the speed indicator
showed that they had attained a velocity of fifty
miles an hour and their maximum speed had not
by any means been reached.</p>

<p>Jack knew that with new machinery it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
have been risking over-heated bearings and all
manner of engine trouble, to let the Electric Monarch
out to her full capacity.</p>

<p>Jack’s cheeks glowed and his eyes shone as the
craft drove onward, with his firm hands on the
controlling wheel. It was invigorating and
blood-quickening to feel the way in which the
Electric Monarch responded instantly to every
move of the controlling devices.</p>

<p>“Of course the Electric Monarch isn’t mine,
nor have I any right to any share in her but the
builder’s, and yet I can’t help feeling that we all
have a part in her,” said the boy to himself. “That
Jeptha Nevins must have been a wonder. If he
had only lived, this would have been a proud day
for him. He certainly left Ned a great legacy
in those plans. I wonder&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Jack broke off short in his ruminations. The
plans! It was true they were in the safe at High
Towers, but it was also true that just the moment
before sailing they had learned that enemies were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
interested in securing them. Enemies backed by
powerful interests, too, judging by what Heiny
Dill had said.</p>

<p>A troubled look crossed Jack’s face. His father
was ill. In case intruders gained access to
the library, he could make but a feeble resistance.
But the next moment he dismissed the thought as
ridiculous. How could any one know where the
plans had been placed? And even so, if an attempt
was made to blow open the safe, the servants
would be bound to hear.</p>

<p>“Just the same,” thought the boy, “I wish we’d
notified the police before we started.”</p>

<p>But at that moment a wind flaw struck the
Electric Monarch and Jack’s attention was fully
occupied in handling the craft as she heeled over
like a ship in a heavy sea. When she was once
more on an even keel, he had other matters to occupy

<small>NED’S TERRIBLE PERIL.</small></h2>


<p>Beneath the Electric Monarch, soaring eagle-like
far above it, a glimmering speck against the
blue, lay the Atlantic. The ocean was in a calm
mood. Viewed from above, its surface appeared
to be as smooth as a mirror.</p>

<p>But Jack knew that appearances were deceptive.
The Atlantic is never absolutely at rest.
Even on the calmest days its bosom heaves with
long, swinging swells, running shoreward to
break in heavy, thunderous surf on the beach. He
drew from a pocket beside the wheel the glasses
with which the receptacle was equipped.</p>

<p>Controlling the wheel with one hand, he raised
the glasses to his eyes with the other. He gazed
downward through them and saw that the sea
was lazily swelling in long, oily combers, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
could be ridden with ease even by a cockleshell of
a boat, whereas the Electric Monarch was actually
two capable cabin cruisers fastened together
Siamese-twin-like by ligaments of vanadium and
steel and aluminum alloy.</p>

<p>“It’s safe enough to go down,” said Jack to
himself and sounded two blasts on the electric
whistle.</p>

<p>This was the signal to the engineer to come
into the pilot house for a consultation. Ned soon
presented himself. He was grimy but happy.</p>

<p>“How’s everything running?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Smooth as oil. You’d think the motors had
been in commission for a long time instead of being
on their initial trip.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. I didn’t have much fear but
they would work all right. I’m going to try a
drop, Ned.”</p>

<p>Jack watched Ned narrowly to see if the news
had any effect upon him but Ned simply nodded
his head in a business-like way and remarked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well, sir.”</p>

<p>At this juncture there came a shrill whistle on
one of the speaking tubes leading to the helmsman’s
wheel.</p>

<p>“Hullo, there’s Tom calling from the stern,”
cried Jack, “wonder what’s up now.”</p>

<p>He placed the tube to his ear and then gave an
exclamation of concern.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s too bad.”</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Why, Tom has an attack of air-sickness. It’s
pretty bad while it lasts, but fortunately it is soon
over. I’m going to call him in to lie down in the
cabin a while. Can you leave your motors and
stand watch astern, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. They’re all right for half an hour,
anyhow. The current’s fine.” The boy glanced
at the indicator, which showed a strong, steady
supply of “juice.” Jack hailed Tom through the
speaking tube and ordered him to come in at once
and lie down. He then hailed Heiny, who by this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
time had gotten over his first scare, and told him
to get some hot coffee ready.</p>

<p>“Tom will be ready for duty before long,” said
Jack, as Ned left the pilot house, passing, as he
made his way aft, Tom, who looked white and ill.
But he assured Ned it was nothing, simply an attack
of air-sickness which would soon pass over.</p>

<p>Ned took up his place in the stern between the
two long supporting frameworks of the rear propellers.
The wind was terrific but otherwise he
felt no inconvenience except from the excessive
vibration. He had not been standing there more
than a few minutes, keeping a watchful eye all
about him, when he noticed that the port stern
bearing of one of the propellers was beginning to
smoke.</p>

<p>“Hullo! We’ll be having a hot box first thing
we know,” said Ned to himself. “I’ve got to oil
that fellow and look sharp about it, too.”</p>

<p>He glanced out over the path he would have to
travel. Ned was a plucky boy, but he felt a qualm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
pass through him as he looked. The propeller
was fully ten feet out from the main structure of
the craft and was supported by a thin framework
of braces.</p>

<p>The task in front of Ned was to straddle this
framework and make his way aft to the heated
bearing, with nothing but 2,500 feet of space beneath
his shoe soles. For a minute he felt tempted
to ask Jack for instructions. But then his pride,
always keen with Ned, came to his rescue.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” he determined, taking a firm grip
on his faculties. “But it’s going to be some job.”</p>

<p>He gripped his oil can firmly, resolved to waste
no more time. Then clambering up to the framework,
he straddled himself over the top part of it,
holding on to the lower part of it as best he could
with his feet.</p>

<p>It was like riding a bucking broncho in mid-air.
The gale from the big propellers swept
around Ned like a hurricane. He felt his cap
swept off his head and dared not look downward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
to watch it go hurtling toward the sea. He knew
that the sight would be too much for his nerves.</p>

<p>Rallying himself with an effort, Ned began his
dangerous crawl along the framework. The
further out from the main structure of the craft
he got the more nerve-racking became the task.
The slender framework shook and swayed as if
it was determined to shake him off, and send him
flying into space.</p>

<p>Ned gripped his handholds till the paint flaked
off on his palms. But little by little he managed
to work his way toward the bearing. The propeller,
a whirring blur before his eyes, dazzled
him. The wind from it seemed to catch his
breath and jam it back down his throat. He
clung to his perch with the courage of desperation.</p>

<p>At last he reached a point from which he could
reach the bearing. He raised the oil cup and
doused the smoking metal with oil. And then,
his duty done, he was horrified to feel a sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
wave of deadly nausea sweep over him. The sea
seemed to rush up toward him, and his senses
swam in a wild delirium.</p>

<p>“I must get back! I must! I must!” he said
to himself, and then the terrible grip of air-sickness
descended upon him again and again, and deprived
him of all power to move.</p>

<p>Almost three thousand feet in the air, perched
on a slender, bucking framework, and a prey to
the most severe form of air-sickness, Ned’s position
was perilous, indeed.</p>

<p>Suddenly he felt his senses leaving him. For
a second he fought against insensibility with all
the power he possessed. But it overmastered
him. Ned felt his head swimming round and
round like a detached body in an aurora of blazing
light. All at once something seemed to give
way.</p>

<p>He felt himself falling! falling!</p>

<p>Then a blackness like night shut down upon
him and he knew no more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>It was perhaps a quarter of an hour later when
Tom presented himself to Jack and announced
that he was fit for duty.</p>

<p>“Very well, Tom, go back to your post and send
Ned to resume his.”</p>

<p>Tom left the cabin. In less than ten seconds
he was back. His face was blanched and his lips
white. Jack noticed he was trembling violently.</p>

<p>“What in the world is the matter, are you ill?”
demanded Jack.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no, it’s Ned.”</p>

<p>“What’s up? Anything the matter with him?”</p>

<p>“He’s&mdash;he’s g-g-g-gone!”</p>

<p>“Gone!”</p>

<p>“That’s right. I went aft and there was no
sign of him. Joyce says nothing has been seen of
him up forward.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!”</p>

<p>The boys faced each other with the fear of a
great calamity on their faces. If Ned was not on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
board he must have fallen from the Electric
Monarch while she was in mid-air. In such a
case there was no need to debate over the fate of
the young comrade they had grown to love.</p>

<p>“I can’t leave the wheel, Tom, you must do
what you can,” said Jack, his voice trembling in
spite of himself.</p>

<p>Tom stammered some reply and left the pilot
house. He summoned young Dill.</p>

<p>“Come aft with me,” he ordered. “We’re
afraid an accident has happened.”</p>

<p>“An accidend! vot sort of an accidend?” blurted
out the German youth.</p>

<p>“We’re afraid that Ned Nevins has fallen overboard.”</p>

<p>“Donnervetter!”</p>

<p>“You must keep a cool head, Dill, and do what
I tell you.”</p>

<p>“I am as cool as a whole barrel of cucumbers,”
was the reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then come with me. There’s one chance in
ten thousand that he may be on board and alive.”</p>

<p>Silently the two made their way aft along the
heaving, swaying bridge, a dreadful fear gnawing
at their hearts.</p>

<small>THE DISGRUNTLED CRONIES.</small></h2>


<p>To say that the departure of the Electric Monarch
from High Towers had caused a sensation in
Nestorville would be putting it mildly. The town
simply went wild.</p>

<p>School was dismissed, business came to a
standstill, and the streets were thronged from
end to end with excited townspeople.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” demanded Hank Nevins,
as the waitress dropped the plate of ham and eggs
she was about to bring him and his worthy companion,
Miles Sharkey, and regardless of the
crash and the spatter, dashed into the street.</p>

<p>“Hark, what’s that they’re calling out?” cried
Hank suddenly.</p>

<p>“Listen!”</p>

<p>Miles put down his knife and fork which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
had grasped expectantly and pricked up his ears.
In another minute the cry,&mdash;which had grown
to a roar,&mdash;came to their ears with the distinctness
of a thunder clap and with much the same
effect.</p>

<p>“Airship!&mdash;Airship!”</p>

<p>The cry reverberated through the village like
a call to arms. Men shouted and women
screamed while small boys went charging up and
down with their heads in the air regardless of
whom they bumped into.</p>

<p>“Great Juniper!” gasped out Hank, spilling his
coffee in his agitation, “do you suppose&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose anything. Let’s make sure,”
cried Miles.</p>

<p>Hatless they rushed into the street but nobody
paid any attention to their agitation. Everybody
was equally excited. It was indeed a thrilling
sight. Far above the heads of the gaping crowd
an immense scarlet and silver shape was skim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>ming
on wings that shimmered in the bright sunlight.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” yelled a man, and a hundred took
up the cry half hysterically.</p>

<p>“It’s flying!” cried out an old lady, as if there
was any doubt about it.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked somebody.</p>

<p>“It’s an airship,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, it ain’t like any I’ve ever saw,” came
the response. “It looks as big as a house. It’s
got cabins on it, too.”</p>

<p>“Must be some more of the work of them boys
up at High Towers,” hazarded Schultz, the blacksmith,
who sometimes did odd jobs for the boys.</p>

<p>“Like as not it is,” agreed somebody else.
“Them boys ’ull break their necks some day,
sure.”</p>

<p>“You mean they’ll make Nestorville famous,”
spoke up Schultz in the capacity of the boys’
champion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> “They’re the brainiest kids in
America to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they don’t amount to very much,” came a
sneering voice behind the sturdy blacksmith.</p>

<p>He faced round instantly. The remark had
come from Hank who, with Miles at his side, was
watching the successful flight with what feelings
may be imagined.</p>

<p>Schultz looked angry and was not afraid to let
his irritation show. Hank began to wish he’d
kept quiet.</p>

<p>“What was that you said, mister?” asked the
blacksmith.</p>

<p>“I just said anybody could do that who had the
time,” said Hank, modifying his speech somewhat.</p>

<p>“Well, you couldn’t do it, mister; it takes
<em>brains</em> to do anything like that. That lets you out.”</p>

<p>The crowd in the vicinity began to titter.
Hank hated being laughed at, and his anger made
him imprudent.</p>

<p>“That’s a stolen idea, anyhow,” he roared out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
at the top of his voice. “The plans from which
that airship was made belong to me.”</p>

<p>“Hush! Are you crazy?” exclaimed Miles,
jerking Hank’s sleeve.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not! They do belong to me. That
craft was designed by my father, Jeptha Nevins,
and I can prove it, what’s more.”</p>

<p>“If that’s so, why didn’t you build one yourself?”
demanded Schultz.</p>

<p>“I didn’t have time to before thieves stole the
plans. I’ll get even, though. I’ll fix ’em. They
won’t rob me!”</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, be quiet. Everybody’s
looking at you. You’ll ruin our plans.”</p>

<p>Miles Sharkey impatiently jerked at Hank’s
sleeve. He would have liked to put an emphatic
hand over his noisy companion’s mouth. But
Hank at last saw reason. As the Electric Monarch
soared off into the distance, melting into the
sky like a vanishing bird, he consented to allow
Miles to lead him away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>They had not gone very far when round a
corner came Sam Hinkley. He was out of breath
and much excited.</p>

<p>“Did you see it?” he cried.</p>

<p>“See it? Do you think we are blind?” roared
Hank. “What kind of bungling is this? Didn’t
you get the lever? How did they come to start?”</p>

<p>“Just what I’d like to know,” said Sam with
equal heat. “I did my part of the work all right.
I detached the lever and hid it in an old well.
They must have had another one some place and
put it on at the last moment.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s it,” said Miles pacifically, but
Hank refused to calm down. It galled his bitter
nature to the quick to see the Electric Monarch
in successful flight when he had hoped and
schemed for a failure.</p>

<p>“I wonder what’s become of the Dutchman,”
he snarled. “He’s ten times brighter than you
are, Hinkley,” which, as we know, was perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
correct, though not in just the way Hank meant
it.</p>

<p>“How do I know where your Dutchman is,”
growled Sam, “I tell you I’m through with you.
I risked a lot to steal that lever and this is all the
thanks I get for it. Gimme my money.”</p>

<p>Hank affected great surprise. So did Miles.
They both stared at Sam as if they thought he
had suddenly taken leave of his senses.</p>

<p>“Money? What money?” exclaimed Miles.</p>

<p>“Why, the money for crippling the machine.”</p>

<p>A cunning smile crept over Miles’s face.</p>

<p>“Yes, the money for crippling the machine!”
he sneered, “but you see, my young friend, you
didn’t do any such thing. In fact, for all we
know, you never went near it.”</p>

<p>“So you’re going to cheat me out of it, eh?”
roared Sam. “But you won’t. I’ll see the police,
I’ll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But he stopped short as Miles burst into a roar
of ironical laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>“See the police and tell them you didn’t get
money for doing some crooked work! You’re
considerable of a fool, Sam Hinkley, but I guess
you aren’t fool enough for that.”</p>

<p>As this was so beyond doubt, Sam had to content
himself with slinking off, muttering threats
about “getting even” which the two conspirators
did not much trouble themselves about. In fact
they were beginning to worry about young Dill.
It was past the hour when he had said he would
meet them, and they began to feel uneasy.</p>

<p>It was as well for their peace of mind that they
did not know the true state of affairs, otherwise
they would have suffered still more perturbation
of spirit.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a><br />

<small>TOM TO THE RESCUE.</small></h2>


<p>With a feeling of anxiety such as he had never
before known, Tom leaned out over the stern
framework. He had hazarded a guess that Ned
might have been rash enough to have attempted
to gain the stern propeller bearings.</p>

<p>But his surprise and relief were not any the
less on that account when he saw, lying limp and
senseless across the slender stern shaft supports,
the body of his young chum, for such Ned had
grown to be in their weeks of work and association.</p>

<p>“Great Glory!” he exclaimed in his relief.
“Heiny, hurray! he’s alive. Had an attack of
air-sickness I guess, and it’s knocked him out.”</p>

<p>But in the midst of his jubilation came another
thought,&mdash;a reflection that sent the hot blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
curdling like ice water through Tom’s veins. Suppose
the boy were suddenly to regain consciousness
and, not realizing where he was, attempt to
raise himself? In such a case he must inevitably
be dashed to death through space.</p>

<p>Still further reflection, after the first gush of
his joy at finding his comrade alive had subsided,
convinced Tom that to get him on board from his
perilous position would be no mean undertaking
in itself. Ned lay some eight feet out from the
end of the “running-bridge.” His inert form was
balanced across the swaying, vibrating framework.
Would that framework&mdash;it looked as
slender as a spider’s web&mdash;bear the weight of the
two boys?</p>

<p>Tom thought it would. He knew the care with
which every section of the Electric Monarch had
been constructed. Every rivet and bolt in her
had been tested and retested to three times the
strain that would be placed upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll risk it,” decided Tom. “Here, Heiny, hold
my coat.”</p>

<p>He stripped off his khaki Norfolk swiftly and
handed it to the German who, too stupefied by
the sight of Ned’s perilous position to say anything,
stood gaping, open-mouthed, powerless to
speak or move. He took Tom’s coat mechanically.
Then speech came to him.</p>

<p>“Vot you do, hein?”</p>

<p>“Can’t you see I’m going out there to get Ned
on board again?”</p>

<p>“Himmel! You preak your neg.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>So saying Tom cautiously got astride of the
framework, and began worming his way toward
Ned’s still form. It was terrible work, but Tom
knew that the return trip would be still more accompanied
by peril. Steeling himself to the task
in hand, he worked slowly forward while Heiny
stood petrified watching him.</p>

<p>Foot by foot, or inch by inch, as it seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
Tom, he drew closer to the form of the boy he had
come to rescue. At last he could touch him and
look into his white face.</p>

<p>The boy lay as limp as a bundle, and in Tom’s
eyes it was better so. It made his task so much
the easier. He extended his hands and got a firm
grip on Ned’s body.</p>

<p>Then he began to work his way backwards. It
was agonizing work. In order to keep Ned balanced
on the narrow strut, he was compelled to
use only his feet to steady himself. Both hands
were required to hold Ned on the perilous perch.
Tom dared not look downward. The thought of
the profundity of space that lay beneath them
made him sick and dizzy.</p>

<p>Tom could never tell just how that journey was
made. It was only a few feet, but it seemed like
so many miles. Ever present in his mind, too, was
the danger of Ned’s regaining consciousness and
making some sudden move. In such a case they
might both be doomed to death.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>The wind from the propellers blew against
Tom with vicious intensity. His legs ached as if
they would drop off, for he had them alone to depend
on both for balance and motion. But at
last, somehow or other, he came within reach of
Heiny Dill’s grasp.</p>

<p>The German lad was ready. As Tom felt the
last ounce of his strength oozing from him he
felt, too, a strong grasp on his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Stetty! Stetty!” came a voice in his ears.</p>

<p>“I’m all right,” muttered Tom thickly. He
helped Heiny drag Ned in to safety and then he,
too, almost gave out. But he knew that Jack in
the pilot house would be eagerly awaiting news.
So putting aside his weariness he seized the stern
speaking tube and sent the good news to the
young commander. This done, Ned was taken to
the cabin and restoratives administered from the
Electric Monarch’s medicine chest, with which
she had been provided in the anticipation that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
some day the boys might want to take a long voyage.</p>

<p>Ned, who was naturally full of vitality, was
soon himself again and insisted on taking his
watch at the motors. As for Tom, his buoyant
nature took even less time in recovering from the
strain that had been put upon it. We will leave
it to the imagination what the boys had to say to
each other when Ned learned that it was Tom
who had saved his life at the risk of his own.</p>

<p>Not long after this Jack, who had taken the
craft quite a distance out to sea, determined to
turn back landward and make a swift flight home.
He judged they had done quite enough to prove
the Electric Monarch’s worth and in this the
others agreed with him.</p>

<p>They were perhaps a mile off the shore when
Joyce, on the lookout forward, gave a sudden
sharp hail through the speaking tube.</p>

<p>“Ship below us, sir.”</p>

<p>“What is she?” hailed back Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>“Looks like a steamer. Passenger boat, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“I reckon I’ll give her a call,” said Jack to himself
as he hung up the tube. “My! won’t her passengers
be surprised, though.”</p>

<p>He took out the binoculars and had a look at
the steamer Joyce had made out. She was a fair-sized
vessel with one black funnel amidships.
Her white upperworks showed she was a passenger
craft.</p>

<p>Jack hailed Ned Nevins on the engine platform.</p>

<p>“Put on your best bib and tucker, Ned, we’re
going calling.”</p>

<p>“Calling!” came back the astonished exclamation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>
<p>“Yes, deep sea calling. Hail Tom and tell him
to look his prettiest. Too bad we didn’t bring
any cards.”</p>

<small>SALUTING A STEAMER.</small></h2>


<p>The Electric Monarch gave a dive and a swoop
that caused all Heiny Dill’s qualms to come back
tenfold.</p>

<p>“Himmel! Ve are sinking. Man der boat-lifes!”
he yelled, but nobody paid any attention
to him and he speedily recovered his equanimity,
and with his rotund face poked out of the cabin
port watched, with as much interest as any one
else on board, the approach of the steamer.</p>

<p>“She’s a Boston and Portland liner bound
north,” declared Jack to Ned Nevins who, as the
motor did not need any attention just then, stood
at the young skipper’s side in the pilot house.</p>

<p>“How can you tell?”</p>

<p>“By her smokestack. Black with a white
band.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>On came the steamer as the Electric Monarch
swooped downward in a graceful curve to meet
her. As the hydroaeroplane commenced her
dive, there burst from the steamer’s whistle a jet
of white smoke. Immediately after, the boys
heard the booming greeting of the vessel’s siren.</p>

<p>Jack pressed the button that controlled the
Electric Monarch’s siren and the next moment
the hydroaeroplane was screeching an answering
salute. They were now quite close to the
steamer and could see her uniformed officers on
the bridge and her decks black with passengers,
their upturned faces looking like white discs.</p>

<p>“My! I’ll bet there’s a tall lot of speculation
going on on board that craft right now,” said
Ned, as the two boys gazed downward.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right. It isn’t every day that
the passengers of a liner have a chance to see a
craft like this in action,” was the response.</p>

<p>Excitement did, indeed, appear to be rife on
board the craft beneath them. Passengers could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
be seen clambering to all sorts of points of vantage.
Handkerchiefs were frantically waved and
the ship’s whistle was kept constantly roaring salutes.</p>

<p>Astern of the Electric Monarch fluttered the
Stars and Stripes. Jack snatched up the speaking
tube connecting with the stern lookout post.
When Tom responded he ordered him to dip the
colors in response to the steamer’s salutes.</p>

<p>A few moments afterward Jack and Ned saw
the liner’s ensign glide slowly down the jack-staff
and then ascend again as she acknowledged the
mid-air courtesy.</p>

<p>“Can’t we turn and follow her?” asked Ned, as
the steamer, with a great creamy bow wave curling
away from her sharp cutwater, sped on her
way.</p>

<p>“Certainly. For a short distance, anyway. We
might as well show them our paces.”</p>

<p>Jack swung the Electric Monarch in a sharp
circle and they could feel the equilibrium devices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
grate and vibrate as the big craft was “banked”
at a sharp angle. By this time the steamer had
put quite an interval between herself and the
Electric Monarch. But Jack let the hydroaeroplane
out a notch more than he had been doing.</p>

<p>The Electric Monarch answered the quickened
impulses of her propellers like a race horse. In
a flash, as it seemed, she was once more abreast
of the steam vessel.</p>

<p>“Look,” cried Ned, suddenly, “there’s a man
clambering up on the jack-staff.”</p>

<p>The venturesome passenger had gained the
stern railing. He hopped to the top of it and
then began to swarm up the jack-staff from the
summit of which fluttered the flag. Holding on
with one hand he waved frantically with the
other. The boys were in the act of acknowledging
the salute when Jack gave a sharp cry.</p>

<p>“Gracious! He’s overboard!”</p>

<p>Like a stone the man had suddenly dropped
from the jack-staff into the swirling water astern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
of the steamer. How he had lost his hold was
a mystery. It all happened in a flash. One second
he was waving, the next they saw him falling
down into the sea and then the waters closed
over him.</p>

<p>The steamer’s whistle sounded in short quick
jerks. It was the signal to man the lifeboats.
The boys could see the passengers and the crew
rushing about in seeming confusion, but in the
case of the latter, as they knew, the apparent
chaos represented order.</p>

<p>And now, amidst the white, boiling wake of the
vessel, they could make out the dark speck of a
man’s head. He was swimming for his life,
swimming desperately to avoid being drawn into
the suction of the propeller. Jack’s hand sought
a lever.</p>

<p>Ned looked at him questioningly. But he did
not speak. He was pretty sure in his own mind
what the young skipper of the Electric Monarch
was going to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>This belief was speedily verified. Jack drew
back the lever and the planes took a downward
slant. Simultaneously Jack flashed on the red
lights that signaled to the stern and bow lookouts
that a descent was to be made. Joyce in the bow
and Tom in the stern had seen the accident, but of
course had not left their posts. The flash of the
red lamps at their stations apprised them that
the Electric Monarch was about to make her first
essay at saving life.</p>

<p>Down shot the big craft with a swiftness that
made it seem as if she must inevitably shoot
straight to the bottom of the sea. Even Ned,
secure as he felt while Jack had the wheel, flashed
a doubtful look at the young skipper. But he
said nothing and the next moment he was to be
glad that he had remained silent.</p>

<p>With iron nerve, Jack allowed the Electric
Monarch to drop like a swooping fish eagle, and
then, without the quiver of a muscle, he turned
apparent disaster aside with a swift manipula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>tion
of the leveling lever. The bow of the Electric
Monarch raised and struck the water at an
angle that caused her to glide along the surface
much as a newly launched vessel might take to
sea.</p>

<p>It was a masterly bit of handling. The spray
flew high above the Electric Monarch, completely
hiding her for an instant from the view of those
on board the steamer. A great cry went up when
it was seen that she was safe and riding like a
duck on the heaving surface of the sea. To many
of those on board it had appeared as if the big
craft must have sunk. Their relief expressed
itself in a mighty cheer.</p>

<p>Those on board the Monarch felt no less relief.
Tom and Joyce had stuck grimly to their posts
but both had felt their hearts beat quicker as they
neared the water. As it was, a good drenching
was all they had received, and they had but scant
time to give any attention to that, for Jack instantly
headed the Electric Monarch in the di<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>rection
in which the bobbing head of the swimmer
had last been seen.</p>

<p>Presently Ned gave a shout.</p>

<p>“There he is!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, not twenty yards from the Electric
Monarch as she lay on the waves, was the
form of the swimmer.</p>

<p>“Stick it out! We’ll get you!” shouted Tom,
from his post astern.</p>

<p>The swimmer waved a confident hand in reply.
He did not appear at all incommoded by his accident.
On the contrary, he was swimming
leisurely as if he rather enjoyed his bath than
otherwise. The boys gazed at him in astonishment.
Within the next few minutes they were
destined to be yet more surprised.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a><br />

<small>AN OLD FRIEND.</small></h2>


<p>The surprise in store for them was this. The
swimmer was an old friend of theirs.</p>

<p>“Captain Sprowl!” shouted Jack, as they
neared him.</p>

<p>“Aye! aye! my hearty!” came back the response,
in the old New Englander’s hearty voice,
“lay alongside and I’ll come aboard.”</p>

<p>“What, you know him!” demanded Ned.</p>

<p>“Do we? I should say so. He was in command
of Professor Dinkelspeil’s yacht when the
mutineers sunk her. After that he was with us
all through that Amazon country I told you
about.”</p>

<p>But it was no time to enter into explanations.
The Electric Monarch was skillfully maneuvered
alongside the doughty old mariner before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
boats from the steamer had fairly left the vessel’s
side. Tom, who had also recognized Captain
Sprowl, ran forward from his post in the stern
and threw him a line. Five minutes later they
were all standing in the pilot-house listening to
the captain’s story of how he had come to loosen
his hold of the jack-staff and plunge into the sea.</p>

<p>“You see, my hearties,” he said, “I was sure it
was you in this here sky-hooting, sea-scooting
contraption and so I says to myself, ‘I’ll give ’em
a proper salute, I will, ship-shape, man-o-war
fashion.’”</p>

<p>“Well, you certainly did, Captain,” laughed
Jack, “but what in the world were you doing on
that ship?”</p>

<p>The captain looked knowing.</p>

<p>“I am on my way to Portstown, Maine,” he
said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> “There’s a big fair there next week and
one of the features of it is to be an aerial carnival.
I’m to be in charge of the airship part of it and
I’ve booked some of the best aviators in the
country.”</p>

<p>The boys looked interested. Anything to do
with airships always appealed to them.</p>

<p>“It’s just come to me,” resumed the captain,
“that maybe you’d like to bring this contraption
up thar’ and try for some of the prizes. What do
you say?”</p>

<p>It was characteristic of Captain Sprowl that,
regardless of his wet clothes and recent narrow
escape, he made no more of it than if everything
was all right and he had come on board the
Electric Monarch in quite the ordinary course of
events.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, Captain, this ship, the Electric
Monarch we call it, isn’t ours at all. It really
belongs to Ned Nevins here.”</p>

<p>“That is, a share of it does,” spoke Ned modestly.</p>

<p>“Well, what does Ned say?” inquired the captain,
as Heiny entered the pilot house with steam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>ing
hot coffee which Jack had ordered got ready
as soon as they struck the water.</p>

<p>“Ned says&mdash;yes!” responded the lad, “but how
about you, Jack and Tom?”</p>

<p>“So far as I’m concerned I think it would be
a splendid thing,” said Jack. “It would give us
a chance to try out the Electric Monarch in competition
with other air craft, and then, too, the
voyage up there would put her through her paces
in great shape. My answer is&mdash;yes.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” declared Tom with positiveness.</p>

<p>“Ches, dot suids me,” said Heiny, balancing his
tray like a born waiter while the captain gulped
down his steaming coffee.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll call it settled,” said the captain.
“I’ll send you entry blanks on my arrival at
Portstown. Be ready to start as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that, Captain,” said Jack,
“we certainly shall be ready.”</p>

<p>By this time the boats from the steamer had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
come alongside and the singular interview had to
be concluded.</p>

<p>“Well, I think it is safe to say that a business
deal was never conducted under more curious
auspices than this one,” laughed Jack, as the captain
prepared to board one of the boats. “I guess
you’d be ready to talk business if you fell out of
a balloon, Captain.”</p>

<p>“If there was an undertaker handy, I would,”
said the captain. And with a cheerful wave of
his hand, the stout old seaman stepped into a
boat and was rowed back to the steamer.</p>

<p>As the vessel got under way again the Electric
Monarch took to the air, rising as easily from the
water as she had from the land. With parting
cheers and mutual salutes the two craft parted,
the steamer to resume her northward voyage, the
Electric Monarch to turn homeward after an
eventful trial trip which, so far as the boys could
see, had been a success in every particular.</p>

<p>On the homeward voyage some brisk breezes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
were encountered, but the Electric Monarch behaved
splendidly. A short distance outside the
village of Enderby, Jack, who had surrendered
the wheel to Ned, in order to initiate him into
handling the craft that bore his name, spied a
black dot in the distance.</p>

<p>It was high in the air and traveling rapidly
toward them. It was some minutes before they
made out what it was.</p>

<p>“A balloon!” They all made the discovery
simultaneously. The big gas bag was traveling
fast and on a course which would bring it across
the Electric Monarch’s bows. As it came closer
they saw that it was colored a brilliant red and
bore on the sides of its gas bag in huge letters,
“New Yorker.”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s one of the balloons that went up
in that contest at New York,” cried Jack. “They
started from Brooklyn last night. My! they’ve
made good time.”</p>

<p>On came the balloon, driving fast. In it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
two men clad in khaki and wearing close-fitting
caps. They waved frantically to the lads in the
Electric Monarch and the hydroaeroplane was
brought close alongside the balloon, keeping up
with it easily.</p>

<p>One of the men in the balloon basket snatched
up a megaphone. Placing it to his lips, he
shouted:</p>

<p>“Ahoy! what craft is that?”</p>

<p>“The Electric Monarch of Nestorville, Mass.,”
rejoined Jack, in true air-sailor fashion. “What
craft is that?”</p>

<p>“The New Yorker, of New York, pilots Augustus
Yost and Alan Frawley, will you report
us?”</p>

<p>“We sure will. When are you coming down?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know. This is an endurance race&mdash;we’ll
keep up as long as possible. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” and so ended a scene which ten
years ago would have been scoffed at as impossible,
yet it was only the other day that news<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>paper
readers perused the account of an aeroplane
towing a disabled dirigible into her hangar.</p>

<p>But we must now hasten home to High Towers
with the boys. They arrived there without further
incident, having made excellent time. The
workmen who had been left behind were there to
help them make a landing, and once more the
Electric Monarch rested on dry land.</p>

<p>Hardly had she touched the ground, however,
before Jupe was seen running from the house
at top speed. He was shouting something, but till
he got close by they could not make out what it
was. Then his words became clearer.</p>

<p>“It’s my father!” cried Jack, in an alarmed
voice.</p>

<p>“What can be the matter?” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but it must be something serious,”
declared Jack, with a pale face, as Jupe
came panting up.</p>

<p>“Oh, Massa Jack,” he wailed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> “yo’ fadder am
turrble sick, sah. Dey heard de bell ring an’
hurry up to der liberry. Dey foun’ him lyin’ on
de flo’ widout his senses.”</p>

<p>“Gracious!” cried Jack, “we must hurry to the
house at once.”</p>

<p>“An’&mdash;an’ dat ain’ de wustest,” stammered out
Jupe.</p>

<p>“Well, what else?”</p>

<p>“De do’ ob de safe done be open an’ it look lak’
some papers bin done taken out!”</p>

<small>THE LOST PLANS.</small></h2>


<p>But, for the time being, the condition of the
safe did not occupy any place in Jack’s thoughts.
His sole care was for his father. Hastening to
the house at top speed, he found that Professor
Chadwick had been placed in bed and a physician
summoned.</p>

<p>The doctor was coming out of the room just
as Jack, with a pale, agitated face, came flying in.</p>

<p>“Oh! Dr. Goodenough,” he exclaimed, “how
is dad? What has happened?”</p>

<p>“Be calm, my lad,” said the doctor kindly,
placing a hand on the excited boy’s shoulder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
“Your father has suffered nothing worse than
an attack of vertigo brought on by overwork and
study. A few weeks’ quiet will make him perfectly
well again, and then I shall forbid him
overexerting himself.”</p>

<p>“Can I see him?” asked Jack eagerly.</p>

<p>“Not just now. He is still only partly conscious.
From what I can gather, the servant who
answered the bell found him lying on the floor
of the library unconscious. He was carried to
his room, and I was sent for at once.”</p>

<p>“When can I see him?” demanded Jack anxiously,
and Tom, who had now arrived, repeated
the question.</p>

<p>“Probably this evening, when I shall pay another
visit.”</p>

<p>“He is only suffering from vertigo, doctor?”
asked Jack, with curious insistence, “not from
any&mdash;any injuries?”</p>

<p>“Injuries? I don’t understand you.”</p>

<p>“He had not been in any struggle, then?
That’s what I mean.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. What an odd question!” The
doctor looked at Jack quizzically. “I shall have
you under my care next,” he said jokingly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>
<p>“I thought that perhaps&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Jack hesitated.</p>

<p>“Go on, my lad. I can see there is something
on your mind. What is it?”</p>

<p>“Just this, doctor. Old Jupe, our colored man,
told me that the door of the library safe, in which
some valuable papers were deposited, was open
when my father was found.”</p>

<p>The doctor’s face grew serious.</p>

<p>“I knew nothing of this,” he said. “Were
there any signs that a violent entry had been effected?”</p>

<p>“That I don’t know, doctor. Naturally I came
here first to find out my father’s condition.”</p>

<p>“It need give you no worry, my boy. I can
assure you of that. Let us go to the library at
once. What you have just told me may place a
very different light on the matter.” And the
doctor’s face grew serious.</p>

<p>“How is your father, Jack?”</p>

<p>Jack turned, and saw Ned Nevins, who was,
by this time, one of the household, at his elbow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
The boy’s face was troubled, for he had a genuine
affection and regard for the good Professor.</p>

<p>“He has simply had a stroke of vertigo. It is
nothing serious, Dr. Goodenough says. But,
Ned, the safe&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know. I heard what Jupe said.”</p>

<p>“Ned, the papers&mdash;your papers&mdash;may be
stolen. How can I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Say nothing about it, Jack. So long as your
father has not been injured I do not care. Do
you think that gang of rascals would have dared
to break in here?”</p>

<p>“We can’t tell anything till we have examined
the library. We are going there now. Come
along.”</p>

<p>In the library everything was in order. The
servant who had answered the bell was summoned
and declared that things were exactly as
they were when she replied to the Professor’s
summons. He was lying at the foot of a desk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
when she entered the room and was quite unconscious.</p>

<p>“Let us examine the safe,” said Dr. Goodenough.</p>

<p>The door of the safe was ajar, and the servant
declared that it had not been touched by any one
since the discovery of the Professor’s unconscious
form.</p>

<p>“You are quite certain of this?” asked the
doctor.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir. Positive.”</p>

<p>“Jack, where were the papers put?”</p>

<p>“In a drawer inside the safe, doctor.”</p>

<p>The boy had swung the door of the safe open,
and the next instant he turned a white, startled
face on the others.</p>

<p>“The drawer is empty. It has been robbed!”
he exclaimed excitedly.</p>

<p>“Keep cool, my boy,” admonished the doctor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
“You are sure the safe was closed when you
left?”</p>

<p>“I shut it myself, doctor. There is not a chance
that I could be mistaken.”</p>

<p>“And the combination?”</p>

<p>“I gave it to my father with my own hands.
It was the last thing I did before I left.”</p>

<p>“Then the safe could only have been forced
open unless some one possessing the combination
opened it.”</p>

<p>“That is the only way any one could have
gained access to its contents.”</p>

<p>“And yet there is not the slightest evidence
that these doors have been forced,” said the
doctor, who had been examining the safe. “This
is a most mysterious occurrence.”</p>

<p>“How could the robbers have opened it?” demanded
Jack.</p>

<p>“How did they get in, anyhow?” Tom wanted
to know. The boy had been looking about the
room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> “This window is closed and locked with
a snap-lock on the inside. Uncle must have felt
chilly and closed it, or was it shut when you left,
Jack?”</p>

<p>“It was shut,” said Jack positively. “I recollect
that, because I asked dad if he didn’t want
it closed, and he asked me to shut it.”</p>

<p>“There’s soft mould in the flower bed outside,”
struck in Ned. “If any one had come in
that way they must have left their footprints on
the dirt.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” agreed the doctor. “Let us look
at the ground outside the window.”</p>

<p>But an examination of the flower bed only
deepened the mystery. It was a bed about five
feet wide, and there was no possibility of any
one’s having stepped across it without leaving the
imprint of his feet. It had rained two days before,
too, so that the ground was moist and would
have readily retained any impression.</p>

<p>Yet there was not the slightest trace of a footprint
to be seen. The little group exchanged
puzzled glances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perhaps somebody got in by the front door,”
suggested Jack, but on inquiry it was learned
that Jupe had been busy polishing floors in the
front part of the house most of the day, and
nobody could have got past without being seen.
The only other entrance to the house was by the
kitchen, and the cook was certain that nobody
had come in through her domain.</p>

<p>As a last resort they examined the scuttle on
the roof. It locked on the inside, and the fastenings
had not been tampered with. Completely
nonplussed, the investigators halted and talked
matters over. Dr. Goodenough eventually decided
to question Professor Chadwick that evening
if he should be strong enough.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, the mystery of the theft
of the papers cast a gloom over the household.
Jack felt that he was partly responsible, and said
so to Ned Nevins. But the latter indignantly
bade him to say nothing about it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>
<p>“Let us be glad that the robbers did not injure
your father,” he said. “The plans are gone and
that is all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“But if they are not recovered, Ned, how can
we ever make restitution to you?”</p>

<p>“If they are not recovered we still have the
Electric Monarch. We must hurry and draw up
another set of plans based upon her structure
and rush them through the patent office.”</p>

<p>“That’s about the only thing to do,” agreed
Jack ruefully, “but I can’t tell you how bad I
feel, Ned, over the loss of your property which
you entrusted to our care.”</p>

<p>“Forget it,” said Ned boyishly, and, although
the expression was slangish, it conveyed to Jack
a sense of consolation, for he felt that Ned would
never blame him for the loss of Jeptha Nevins’s
lifework.</p>

<small>A BAFFLING ROBBERY.</small></h2>


<p>Dr. Goodenough’s visit that night did not serve
to throw any light on the mystery of the safe
robbery. In the meantime the police had been
summoned, and investigated the premises without
getting any nearer a solution of the puzzle
than the boys and Doctor Goodenough had done.</p>

<p>Jack had taken it upon himself that afternoon
before supper to telephone to the Hinkley House.
He learned there that Sam was out and not expected
back for some time. Heiny Dill was dispatched
to the village to learn further particulars,
and returned with the report that Hank
Nevins and Miles Sharkey had both left the
Hinkley House shortly before his arrival on the
scene.</p>

<p>The young amateur detective had trailed them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
as far as the depot, only to find that they had
taken the train bound south a few moments before
he arrived. He had learned, however, that
they had spent most of the day previous to their
departure in the hotel. This only served to make
matters the more baffling.</p>

<p>By common consent, whether justly or unjustly,
the boys had been inclined to suspect either
Hank or Miles with being concerned in the robbery.
But it seemed that they had a complete
alibi. Sam Hinkley, too, had been seen about
the village on and off most of the day, and thus
he also was eliminated. But the boys had not
suspected Sam in the matter, anyway, so this
information was not a surprise to them.</p>

<p>“This is a mystery for fair,” declared Jack,
when Heiny Dill had duly reported the facts to
him. “Fellows, we are stumped.”</p>

<p>“Possibly to-night your father will be able to
talk and throw some light on the matter,” suggested
Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perhaps so. I am sure I hope that he will.
A mystery like this gets on your nerves. The
only people I can think of who knew of the existence
of the plans, except ourselves, are Hank
and his friend Sharkey. From what you say of
them, Ned, I guess they wouldn’t stick at anything;
from what Heiny Dill has found out we
know it was impossible for them to be here at
about the time of the robbery. Dad was found
unconscious about an hour after we left. At
that time Hank and his friend were in the village.
They were seen there talking to Sam Hinkley.”</p>

<p>“If we could get hold of Sam maybe he could
tell us something,” suggested Tom.</p>

<p>When Dr. Goodenough arrived that evening
he informed Jack that Professor Chadwick had
sufficiently recovered to be able to talk. With
what eagerness they all awaited the outcome of
that interview may be imagined. But so far as
helping to clear up the mystery was concerned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
Professor Chadwick was as powerless as any of
them.</p>

<p>“After Jack had closed the window and left,”
he said, “I lay down upon the lounge. After a
time I felt better and thought I would get a book.
I rose from the couch and went toward the bookcase.
I can recollect nothing more till I found
myself in bed with Dr. Goodenough in attendance
on me.”</p>

<p>“Nothing else at all?” gently urged the doctor.</p>

<p>“Nothing except that Jupe came in to tell me
that the Electric Monarch had started successfully
on her maiden voyage.”</p>

<p>“You can recall nobody attempting to force the
window or open the safe?”</p>

<p>Professor Chadwick shook his head positively.</p>

<p>“Nothing like that at all, doctor,” he said, with
conviction.</p>

<p>“And nobody but Jupe entered the room, to
your knowledge?”</p>

<p>“Nobody,” declared Professor Chadwick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> “and
I think we can safely leave Jupe out of the question.”</p>

<p>Late that night Jack called up the Hinkley
House and discovered that Sam had not returned.</p>

<p>“I thought he was up to your place,” said Landlord
Hinkley. “I’ve no idee whar’ the boy hes
gone. He ain’t often out this late at night. I
hope he ain’t up to any monkey shines. If he be,
I’ll whale him good, big as he be.”</p>

<p>Jack decided that it was no use telling Sam’s
father of all that had occurred since the morning.
But when he hung up the receiver he was
a sadly perplexed boy. When Heiny Dill departed
for the hotel that night he promised to
find out what he could. On his return the next
morning he reported that a wire had been received
from Sam, who said that he was going
to New York. Landlord Hinkley found, incidentally,
that the funds to finance Sam’s journey
had been taken from his cash drawer. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
the sum total of young Dill’s information, and
it was not enlightening.</p>

<p>In fact, it complicated the puzzle, for if Sam
was not implicated in the robbery, and there was
nothing to make them believe that he was, there
was no apparent reason why he should decamp so
suddenly, unless he feared that he might be prosecuted
for the theft of the lever. The boys,
therefore, were forced to conclude that this was
the reason for Sam’s flight.</p>

<p>As for the sudden departure of Hank and
Miles Sharkey, that was more understandable.
They had practically hired Sam to make his desperate
attempt to cripple the Electric Monarch,
and knew that their plans must have been foiled
when they saw the craft take to the air. This
being so, they had probably argued that Sam
would be arrested and would implicate them.
Flight, then, must have seemed to them to be
their wisest course.</p>

<p>And so, for the present, the mystery of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
stolen plans had to be given up by the police and
those most interested in the recovery of the
papers, as an unsolvable puzzle. Of the startling
way in which it was to be cleared up, none of
those concerned had the slightest inkling. From
day to day the boys feared to hear of the plans
being filed in the patent office. But, although
through Prof. Chadwick’s patent lawyers in
Washington, they kept in constant touch with
the National Capital, no such papers turned up.
In the meantime the boys busied themselves making
as complete a set of duplicate plans as possible,
covering every patentable feature of the
Electric Monarch.</p>

<small>OFF TO THE FAIR.</small></h2>


<p>Two days after the mysterious disappearance
of the plans of the Electric Monarch the promised
entry blanks for the Aëro Carnival at Portstown
arrived. Inclosed with them the worthy
captain had sent a copy of a Portstown newspaper
in which there was announced in flaring
capitals the following:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>
<p>“Captain Abe Sprowl, in charge of the Aëro
Carnival, announces that he has engaged, at unprecedented
expense, the newest marvel of the
air, the motor-driven hydroaeroplane, The Electric Monarch,
owned and invented by Ned
Nevins, the youthful inventor. The machine will
make a flight from Nestorville to the show
grounds, and will be on view daily during the
carnival.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of that?” gasped out
Jack, as he read this flamboyant announcement
out aloud to his companions. “As a press agent
Captain Sprowl is certainly a wonder. It looks
as if we’d have to go now, boys, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It sure does,” agreed Tom, “but I wish he
hadn’t run that fool notice. We don’t want all
that notoriety just now.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed. Not till the plans are all safely
filed in the patent office,” agreed Ned, with a
serious look. “Queer, that whoever took the
other set hasn’t tried to place them on record
yet, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can’t understand it,” agreed Jack; “it
looks as if they had something up their sleeves
that we know nothing about. However, there
is no use worrying over it. I guess we ought to
be thankful that things are as they are.”</p>

<p>Heiny Dill arrived a few moments later. In
honor of his new job he had purchased a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
flaring tie than ever, and his socks were of a
lurid purple.</p>

<p>“Any news of Sam, Heiny?” inquired Jack, as
the young German sauntered up, whistling
blithely, to where the lads stood grouped about
the Electric Monarch, on which some minor adjustments
were being made.</p>

<p>“Nodt a vord,” responded young Dill, “he hass
made idt a vanishment as if he hadt dropped der
eardt off.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t hear any complaints about his
absence,” declared Tom. “So far as we are concerned
we don’t care if he never comes back.
I’m sorry for his father, though.”</p>

<p>“Veil, der oldt man is bearing oop midt remargable
composure alretty,” declared Heiny,
cocking his head on one side and giving a “yodle”
more remarkable for vigor than harmony.</p>

<p>“When do we start, fellows?” asked Jack that
afternoon when he had filled out the entry blanks
and they had been mailed by Heiny Dill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Electric Monarch is ready to go this
minute,” said Tom. “I was just talking to
Joyce.”</p>

<p>“Then what do you say about to-morrow?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Suits me,” said Ned, who wanted nothing better
than to be riding in the Electric Monarch
again.</p>

<p>“Me, too,” said Tom. “I’m tired of being on
<i lang="la">terra firma</i>.”</p>

<p>So it was arranged that the start for the Portstown
Fair should be made the next morning.
Professor Chadwick was still too weak to attempt
to accompany the boys, but he wished them all
sorts of luck and a good time.</p>

<p>“We’re sure to have a good time, anyhow,”
Tom assured him.</p>

<p>Till late that night the boys worked on stocking
up the larder of the Electric Monarch with
all manner of canned foods. Heiny Dill, who
was as fond of good things as most boys, watched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
these preparations with glittering eyes. He
smacked his lips visibly as he stowed away the
provisions on shelves in his domain.</p>

<p>The boys slept little that night, awaking early
to find it a slightly overcast morning with a
promise of fair weather later on. There was
but little wind, however, and everything appeared
to be propitious for a speedy, uneventful
voyage to Portstown.</p>

<p>Before leaving, Jack affixed to the “navigation-desk,”
in the pilot house, an “aërial map” of
the route. This was a map on which various
landmarks, easily discernible from a height,
were noted down, and it was issued by the Aëronautical
Society of America. Maps such as these
are of the utmost use to airmen who naturally
would find little to guide them in an ordinary
map or chart. Marked in red ink on the aërial
map were various arrows showing the probable
direction of the wind in crossing various bits of
high ground or in passing over cities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>The air is by no means, as might be imagined,
a smooth road to travel. It is full of “billows,”
aërial “cliffs” caused by up-drafts, and vast,
empty pockets wherein nothing but a vacuum exists,
and which many airmen claim are the greatest
source of danger to aviators that the atmosphere
contains.</p>

<p>As there was nothing to cause delay, the Electric
Monarch’s motors were started spinning almost
as soon as it was broad daylight. Everything
proved to be in perfect order, and after the
tuning-up process the boys took their stations on
the craft. As before, Joyce had the bow lookout
and Ned Nevins alternated between the pilot
house and the motor-platform.</p>

<p>Professor Chadwick and Jupe waved them
farewell as they shot upward, and before very
long the village of Nestorville and High Towers
lay far behind them. Jack sent the Electric Monarch
straight up on an inclined aërial staircase
till she had gained the height of five thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
feet. At this altitude they proceeded steadily
along, the height being sufficient to avoid any
danger from upward thrusting air currents.</p>

<p>The morning passed uneventfully, and shortly
before noon Heiny Dill announced that lunch
was ready. They took this in relays, Ned relieving
Jack at the wheel while the young skipper
ate. They passed over several towns and small
villages, and through the glasses they could
plainly see the flurry they were causing down
below. It amused them to watch the scurrying
atoms which they knew were human beings rushing
about and pointing upward as the Electric
Monarch passed high above their heads.</p>

<p>Not long after lunch, as they were passing over
what seemed to be a large farm, they saw several
men running along below them. Suddenly one
elevated and aimed a gun at the fast flying craft.
Of course the Electric Monarch was far too high
for the charge to reach her, but the boys could
see the puff of smoke that accompanied the dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>charge,
and knew that if they had been lower
they would have felt shot pattering about them.</p>

<p>“That’s a specimen of what Atwood, the trans-continental
flier, had to contend against,” said
Jack. “The more ignorant people are, the more
they dislike to see modern inventions. I’ll bet
if that fellow with the gun could have hit us he
would.”</p>

<p>“His intentions seemed serious, anyhow,”
laughed Ned, “but the Electric Monarch is a hard
bird to bring down.”</p>

<p>About an hour later Jack decided to drop down
closer to the earth. He wished to test the effect
of the currents near to the heated surface on the
Electric Monarch. Accordingly the craft was
brought down till at times she was rushing along
at not more than two or three hundred feet from
the earth.</p>

<p>They were flying over a large, prosperous-looking
farm at a fair rate of speed when there
came a sudden check in the air craft’s movement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
She plunged violently and pitched forward as
if about to capsize.</p>

<p>“It’s the grapnel line!” shouted Ned, “it’s gotten
loose and hooked on to the roof of that barn!”</p>

<p>At the same instant there came a sound of
rending and tearing wood as the steel points of
the grapnel dug into the roof of a rickety old
barn and tore it loose from the rafters. Jack
acted like a flash. He set his descending planes
and came to earth in a beautifully executed dive
in a stubble field just beyond the farm buildings.</p>

<p>“The grapnel must have torn loose from its
fastenings,” he said; “lucky it was no worse.
As it is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He broke off short. Running toward them
from the farmhouse came the farmer and two of
his hired men. The farmer carried in his hand
a formidable looking gun. As he drew close to
the boys he leveled it at them. At the same time
he cried out angrily:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stay right where ye be. Don’cher move, doggone
yer, er I’ll shoot.”</p>

<p>The look in his eye, as well as the menace in
his voice, convinced the boys that the threat was
no idle one. The man was thoroughly angry
over the accidental damage to his barn. On he
came with leveled gun, shouting threats, while
the two hired men kept up a steady accompaniment.</p>

<p>“Well, this is a fine fix,” commented Jack. “I
guess we’ll have to settle for that roof before we
leave here.”</p>

<p>“You kin jes’ bet ye’ll hev ter,” roared the
farmer, who had overheard him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a><br />

<small>AN UNLUCKY MISHAP.</small></h2>


<p>“That’s all right, sir. We’re willing to pay
you whatever is right for the damage we have
done,” said Jack, in as pacific a voice as he could
assume.</p>

<p>“Fine times these be when a passel of kids kin
come along in a flyin’ contraption an’ take off a
man’s roof!” exclaimed the angry farmer, far
from being pacified.</p>

<p>“It was an accident,” declared Jack; “we are
just as sorry for it as you are.”</p>

<p>The farmer in his rage had paid not the slightest
attention to the Electric Monarch, but his
two hired men stood looking at it with open
mouths. They had never seen anything like it,
and the farmer’s orders to them to “close up”
fell upon deaf ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>“Accident be dol-dinged,” exclaimed Farmer
Turpin angrily; “it warn’t no accident. You
done it a-pupose.”</p>

<p>“We certainly did not,” replied Jack, with
some heat. “Do you suppose we’d want to wreck
our craft for a rotten old roof?”</p>

<p>“Rotten old roof!” bellowed the farmer furiously.
“I’ll show yer how rotten it was. It’ll
cost yer a hundred dollars fer ther damage you’ve
done.”</p>

<p>“Ridiculous,” said Jack, who had been looking
at the damaged roof. It was old and moss-grown
and had covered one of the oldest buildings on
the farm.</p>

<p>The boards of the antiquated structure were
split and paintless. Wind and weather must
have had their way with it for many years. Jack
pointed out these facts to the irate farmer. But
he proved recalcitrant.</p>

<p>“I want a hundred dollars fer thet thar roof er
you don’t go on,” said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>“Rubbish. See here, we don’t want to do damage
and not settle for it, but that isn’t to say that
we can be bled like that. We’re not so foolish.
I’ll give you twenty-five dollars for that six feet
or so of roof we’ve injured.”</p>

<p>An obstinate look, an expression of fixed stubbornness,
came over the farmer’s face.</p>

<p>“I got yer here an’ yer goin’ ter pay my price.
Ther justice of ther peace here ain’t friendly to
automobuls and sich-like, an’ I reckon ef I say
so he’ll give yer all a week in jail as well as a
fine. How’d you like that, hey?”</p>

<p>“Threats like that don’t frighten us,” said
Jack stoutly, although inwardly he began to feel
somewhat worried over the prospects ahead. If
the farmer proved as pig-headed as seemed likely
it might mean that they would have to pay his
outrageous price or else be sent to prison by
some cross-grained old justice of the peace.</p>

<p>Of course the boy felt that the farmer’s threat
was more or less of a “bluff,” but still he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
from experience the prejudice that a great many
people, especially in remote parts of the country,
still felt against automobiles and every innovation
of that type.</p>

<p>“Don’t scare you, hey?” sneered the farmer.
“Wa’al, I cal’kerlate ter put quite a change in yer
feelings afore long. Climb down out ‘er that
thar sky-buggy an’ look slippy.”</p>

<p>The boys held a hasty consultation. Things
began to look bad.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’d better pay the old wooden-head
his hundred and be getting on,” said Ned. “We
don’t want to be arrested or anything like that.”</p>

<p>“I think that’s all a bluff,” said Jack. “Still,
if we humor him it may be better than to fight
him.”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, are yer comin’?” demanded the
farmer.</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up,” growled out Joyce, unable to
contain himself any longer.</p>

<p>“Dry up, hey?” snorted the farmer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> “I guess
you’ll do the dryin’ yerselves. I wouldn’t take
no money now. It’s satisfaction I want. I’ll hev
the whole passel of yer up afore the squire in the
morning.”</p>

<p>This certainly looked ominous. The man was
clearly as stubborn as one of his own oxen, and
had made up his mind to be as ugly as he could.
Jack wished that Joyce had not made his unfortunate
remark and tried to smooth matters over.
But it was no use attempting to calm the ruffled
feelings of the angry agriculturist.</p>

<p>“Climb out of thar now and be right smart
about it,” he snorted. “I’ll show you thet you
can’t sass Si Turpin and not suffer for it.”</p>

<p>“But, see here&mdash;&mdash;” began Jack.</p>

<p>“It ain’t no use argyfyin’, young feller. The
whole passel of yer goes over to Mill Creek in
ther mornin’ I reckin the squire ’ull give you a
lesson you won’t fergit.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you be reasonable?” struck in Tom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
“We’re on our way to Portstown. It’s important
that we hurry up. We’ve got to be there at a
certain time.”</p>

<p>“I don’t give a hoop in Hannibal what ye’ve
got ter do!” snorted the farmer. “You’ve got
to go afore the squire fust. Reckon he’ll soak yer
good. He gave a party of automobubblists a
good dose last week. I reckon he’ll be all cocked
and primed fer you sky-buggy fellers.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it’s a case of pile out,” said
Jack, with a rueful grin. “This old fellow is as
obstinate as a mule. We can only hope to make
a good impression on this squire, whoever he is.”</p>

<p>“To judge from his description,” said Tom,
“he must be a nice, whole-souled old party.”</p>

<p>“No palaverin’, now. Git right out. I’ll fix
you up with quarters in the barn where you won’t
git out, and give yer the rogues’ march in the
morning.”</p>

<p>There was no help for it. One by one they
clambered out, while the hired men stood by with
broad grins. They were delivered over to these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
representatives of the enemy while Farmer Turpin
marched grimly behind with his gun.</p>

<p>“Take ’em to the red barn, Reuben,” he ordered,
and the boys were presently marched into
a large barn partially filled with hay.</p>

<p>“Now I guess ye’ll stay put for a while,” remarked
the farmer, with grim humor, as he prepared
to close the door.</p>

<p>“You old clod-hopper, for two cents I’d bust
that hook nose of yours in,” roared out Joyce
angrily.</p>

<p>“That’ll be used agin’ yer at yer trial!” declared
the farmer malevolently. “Yes, sir, that’ll
be used agin’ yer. Threats of violence, hey? Oh,
the squire will fix you fellers good and plenty.”</p>

<p>The doors were banged to and padlocked on
the outside. For some time they could hear the
farmer pacing up and down as if waiting to see
if they would not make some further complaint.
But they all remained silent. They were determined
not to give him the satisfaction of thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
that he had worried them. Heiny Dill even began
to sing to himself.</p>

<p>By and by the steady pacing of the farmer’s
feet outside died away.</p>

<p>“I guess he’s gone to eat supper,” said Tom.
“My! how hungry I am.”</p>

<p>This reminded all the others of their appetites,
too.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’ll send us something to eat,” suggested
Ned hopefully.</p>

<p>But his optimism was not to be rewarded. It
grew dark and the captives in the barn sat supperless
and disconsolate. They did not face a
pleasant prospect, supposing the squire to be all
that he had been represented by the malevolent
old farmer.</p>

<p>How long they sat thus they did not know, but
on Jack’s suggestion they were about to find
themselves beds in the hay when there came a
tapping at the barn door.</p>

<p>“Supper!” cried Tom, but it wasn’t, it was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
man called Reuben, or Reuben Rugg, as he announced
himself.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Be you fellers goin’ ter Portstown?”</p>

<p>“We were.”</p>

<p>“Well, if a feller let you fellers out would you
give a feller a ride to Portstown if a feller wanted
ter git thar’?”</p>

<p>“We sure would, Reuben. Who wants to go
to Portstown?”</p>

<p>“I’m ther feller that would like ter go with
you fellers. I don’t want ter work fer this feller
any longer an’ if I got to Portstown I’ve got a
feller thar’ thet’s a kind uv er brother-in-law ter
me. So if you fellers want ter git out, this feller
’ull steal the key when old Turpin’s asleep and
turn you loose.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Reuben. How long will it be
before old Turpin, as you call him, goes to bed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jes’ as soon as he gets through writing out
what he calls a commitment agin’ you fellers. I
reckon it ‘ud go hard with you if you was ter be
taken afore the squire. He’s a larruper, the
squire is. He give me a month once fer takin’
too much red-eye and lickin’ ther constabule.”</p>

<p>“Well, you watch and wait, Reuben,” said
Jack; “we’ll be all ready when you are.”</p>

<p>They heard Reuben’s heavy footsteps retreating,
and then followed a period that seemed years
in extent. But at its termination Reuben’s cautious
voice was heard.</p>

<p>“I’m a-goin’ ter open ther door now. Be you
fellers ready?”</p>

<p>“We’ve been ready for the last ten years,” declared
Tom, referring to the length of time it appeared
that Reuben had been gone.</p>

<p>The lock clicked and the doors swung open.
One by one they cautiously filed out and tip-toed
across the yard to the place where the Electric
Monarch lay bulked in dark shadow. Luckily, it
was moonlight, and the craft lay in a sixty-acre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
field so that there was plenty of opportunity to
get a good start.</p>

<p>“Old Turpin didn’t monkey at all with the machine,
did he, Reuben?” asked Jack, as they crept
along. He was not quite sure how far the farmer’s
malevolence might have led him.</p>

<p>Reuben gave a suppressed chuckle.</p>

<p>“Turpin touch it? Not him. He wanted to,
but the old woman told him thet ef he did as like
as not he’d get electric&mdash;something or other.”</p>

<p>“Electrocuted?”</p>

<p>“Likely. Say, be you really going ter Portstown?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. You’re not scared, are you?” said
Jack with an inward smile.</p>

<p>“Naw, but I got a funny kind ‘er prickly feelin’
down my back like what I git when straw gits
down my neck in threshing time,” admitted Reuben
with a nervous giggle.</p>

<small>A DASH FOR LIBERTY.</small></h2>


<p>As silently as possible the escaped captives
made for the Electric Monarch. They had almost
gained the side of the craft when an unexpected
obstacle barred their further progress.
The interruption was in the form of a big white
bulldog.</p>

<p>“Gosh all hemlock!” gasped Reuben, “I plumb
forgot about old Lion.”</p>

<p>“Is he mean?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Mean, wa’al he’s a sight meaner than old
Turpin hisself, and thet’s a-goin’ some.”</p>

<p>As if to show that his character had been described
correctly, Lion gave a low growl and
then, without any further warning, sprang
straight at Jack. The boy jerked up his foot and
caught the animal under the chin. With a yap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>ping
bark it tumbled back, but collected itself in
an instant for another spring.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus-254.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“Maw! Maw!” They heard him yell at the top of his lungs,<br />
“the boys is got out”.&mdash;<i>Page 249</i></div>
</div>

<p>At the same instant the boys heard a window
go up in the farmhouse.</p>

<p>“Wow!” exclaimed Tom, “about this time
watch out for trouble.”</p>

<p>“Lion! Lion!” came a voice which they recognized
as Turpin’s.</p>

<p>The dog gave a yapping bark. Simultaneously
old Turpin must have seen, by the moonlight, that
the barn door in which the boys had been confined
was open.</p>

<p>“Maw! Maw!” they heard him yell at the top
of his lungs, “the boys is got out, gimme my
gun!”</p>

<p>Lion at the same instant decided to make another
attack, but in the brief pause while he was
listening to his master’s voice Tom had taken
time by the forelock and picked up a big rock.
As Lion made another spring Tom flung the
rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a howl of dismay from Lion, who
rushed toward the house. Shouts and cries filled
the air.</p>

<p>“Maw! the young varmints hev killed Lion!”</p>

<p>“Paw, take arter ’em. Hev the law on ’em.”</p>

<p>Then came another feminine voice.</p>

<p>“Look out, paw, they’re des’prit characters.
They might kill you.”</p>

<p>“That’s the old man’s darter. Teaches school,”
said Reuben laconically, “we’d best be lighting
out o’ here.”</p>

<p>They scrambled on board in less time than it
takes to tell it. Jack jumped for the controls and
turned full power into the motor. There was a
yell of dismay from Reuben as the Electric Monarch
leaped forward like a horse under the lash.
The amazed farm hand would have rolled overboard
had it not been for Tom, who grabbed him
by the collar as he lost his balance and fell sprawling
on the bridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hey! Whoa thar’! Come back, you young
varmints!”</p>

<p>The voice of Farmer Turpin came shrilly out
of the night. Then behind them came a streak of
flame and the roar of an explosion. Looking
backward they could see the figure of the farmer
sprawling on his back, kicking and yelling frantically.</p>

<p>“Gosh ter mighty,” exclaimed Reuben, who
was by this time on his feet, “the old man fired
both barrels of his scatter gun ter oncet.”</p>

<p>“Up we go!” cried Jack, and almost simultaneously,
with his exclamation, the Electric Monarch
shot up toward the star-sprinkled sky at an
angle that almost sent Reuben into hysterics.</p>

<p>“Hey, stop this flying threshing machine,” he
yelled, “lemme out! Lemme&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Tom placed a hand over the frightened farm
hand’s mouth.</p>

<p>“You want to get to Portstown, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yer&mdash;yer&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, you’re going there by the air-line express.
Now be quiet. Heiny, for goodness sake,
cook us up some supper, and look lively about it,&mdash;we’re
almost famished.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next morning will be one long remembered
in Portstown. Early rising citizens saw, swooping
down from the skies, a vast aerial craft
manned by a crew of youths anxiously looking
over the side to descry the best landing place.
They had arrived above the town shortly before
daylight but Jack had decided to cruise about till
the light grew stronger, not wishing to risk a
landing in the dark. He adopted, in fact, the
same tactics that the captain of a vessel about
to enter a strange port would employ.</p>

<p>By the time the Electric Monarch swooped
down into the twenty-acre park in which the fair
was to be held, there was a crowd of several hundred
people in the streets clamoring about the entrance
to the fenced grounds. The Electric Mon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>arch
was actually a fact, a circumstance which
was astonishing to a good many of the Portstown
folks who had thought that Captain Sprowl’s
flowery advertisement was a good deal in the nature
of an exaggeration. But now they had seen,
with their own eyes, the most wonderful craft
of its kind in existence, and the whole town was
wild with excitement and curiosity.</p>

<p>Early as the hour was, Captain Sprowl, who
had been on the lookout for the boys, soon came
dashing into the grounds in a runabout automobile.
He extended them a hearty welcome and
showed them where they would be quartered during
the carnival, that is, if they wished to camp
on the grounds. The boys unanimously voted in
favor of the camping proposal. They decided
that it would be much more fun than stopping at
a hotel.</p>

<p>They accompanied the captain to the hotel for
breakfast, however, a big crowd following them
through the streets, much to the boys’ embarrass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>ment.
The captain, however, gloried in the notoriety.</p>

<p>“It shows what good advertising will do,” he
said, glowing with pride, as he escorted his young
charges through the streets. Reuben did not accompany
them. He had gone out to find his
brother-in-law. In the meantime the captain, at
the boys’ solicitation, had promised to get him a
job on the fair grounds if he did not find employment
at anything else, an offer which Reuben subsequently
accepted.</p>

<p>Breakfast was a merry meal, and the boys had
much to tell of their experiences on the trip.
After they had finished, they returned to the fair
grounds and were shown round by the captain.
Several of the aviators who were to take part in
the carnival had already arrived and erected
their tents with gay festoons of bunting floating
over them.</p>

<p>The boys were much disappointed, however, to
learn that an air craft they had been most anx<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>ious
to see was not yet on the grounds. This was
the celebrated Sky Eagle, a big dirigible, equipped
with wireless and one of the first aërial craft to
be so fitted. The captain told them that the
dirigible was on the way, however, and was expected
ere long on the grounds.</p>

<p>“Have you been notified by them, then?” asked
Jack, rather puzzled as to how the captain could
have such information.</p>

<p>“Yes, they sent us a message by wireless not
long since that they expected to arrive to-day.”</p>

<p>“Then there is a wireless plant in the town?”
asked Tom, somewhat surprised.</p>

<p>“There’s one right on the grounds,” rejoined
the captain, “it’s one of the exhibits. See the
aërials over yonder?”</p>

<p>Sure enough, in one corner of the grounds the
spider-like strands of a vertical aërial mast could
be seen leading into a hut about which a small
crowd was clustered. The captain explained that
the operator of the plant was even then trying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
locate the Sky Eagle. He had hardly finished explaining
this when a boy came rushing out of the
wireless hut in hot haste.</p>

<p>“There’s a messenger now. Maybe he’s looking
for me!” cried the captain. “Hey, boy!”</p>

<p>The boy turned and came running toward
them.</p>

<p>“I was just looking for you, Captain,” he said.
“Hutchings, the operator, wants to see you.”</p>

<p>“News from the Sky Eagle?” asked the captain.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but he said it was important.”</p>

<p>The boys hurried after the captain to the wireless
hut. Inside they found Hutchings, the operator,
greatly excited.</p>

<p>“Bad news for you, Captain,” he said, holding
out a yellow sheet of paper, “a message from the
Sky Eagle. She is disabled and drifting out to
sea.”</p>

<p>“By the trident of Neptune!” exclaimed the
captain, scanning the message,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> “this is bad.”</p>

<p>He read the message aloud:</p>


<p>“On Board Sky Eagle.&mdash;We are disabled.
Drifting out to sea off Scatiute. Send help.&mdash;Jennings,
operator.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a><br />

<small>A DIRIGIBLE IN DANGER.</small></h2>


<p>“Where is Scatiute?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“About twenty miles south of here,” responded
the captain. Then turning to the operator he
asked, “Have you tried to get in communication
with the Sky Eagle again?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but with no success. Looks as if her
wireless had gone out of business. That message
came in more than an hour ago. We’ve been
looking all over for you.”</p>

<p>“Great guns, boys, this is serious!” exclaimed
the captain in an agitated voice. “Who knows
what may have happened to those poor fellows!
I must try to get hold of them, somehow. But
just how I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“There’s Alvin’s dirigible on the grounds,”
suggested the operator.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> “Maybe he’d go.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try him,” declared the captain. “It’s in
the cause of common humanity. I should think
he’d go.”</p>

<p>But Lester Alvin, the owner of the Cloud
Scooter, declared he had not enough gasolene to
make the trip. Two other dirigible operators
were appealed to, but both of them had excuses
of one sort or another to offer. The captain hastened
back to the wireless hut where he had left
the boys.</p>

<p>“Any news yet?” he asked anxiously of Hutchings
the operator.</p>

<p>Hutchings shook his head.</p>

<p>“I can’t get in touch with them at all,” he said.
“I can’t even raise a station that’s seen them
passing over.”</p>

<p>The captain passed a bewildered hand across
his forehead.</p>

<p>“What under the heavens are we to do?” he
said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> “I’ve appealed to those dirigible fellows in
vain. They’ve all got one excuse or another to
offer. I guess, though, the main trouble with
them is ‘cold feet’ to put it into plain English.”</p>

<p>“And in the meantime those poor fellows on
the Sky Eagle may be drifting helplessly over
the ocean,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes, and the worst of it is that their wireless
appears to be out of order. If that was working
they could summon help from some ship. But as
it is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The captain broke off despairingly. He gazed
up at the sky as if seeking inspiration there and
then down at the ground. But he remained as
perplexed as before.</p>

<p>In the meantime Jack and his companions had
been holding an eager consultation. As the captain
turned to Hutchings for the twentieth time
with a demand to know if he had heard anything
yet, Jack stepped forward.</p>

<p>“Captain,” he said, “I guess that we can help
you out.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, boy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>“That we will go out on a hunt for the Sky
Eagle.”</p>

<p>The captain looked dumfounded. Then he
gave a vigorous shake of the head.</p>

<p>“No, my boy, I couldn’t allow that.”</p>

<p>“Why not? We have&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be responsible for sending you boys
on such a voyage.”</p>

<p>“There would be no real danger. We have a
capable ship. We know how to handle her. She
is as good on the water as on land.”</p>

<p>“I know all that, Jack, but what would your
father say?”</p>

<p>“That it is our duty to go to the aid of those
poor fellows on the Sky Eagle.”</p>

<p>The captain scratched his head in bewilderment.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to say,” he said hesitatingly,
at length.</p>

<p>Just then Hutchings interrupted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hold on, here’s a message coming now,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Ah! That’s the Sky Eagle,” said the captain.
“We worried ourselves unnecessarily, after all.”</p>

<p>But it was not the Sky Eagle that was wirelessing.
The captain’s rejoicing had been premature.
Hutchings held up his hand to enjoin silence.</p>

<p>Then as the dots and dashes came out of space
into the watch-case receivers at his ears he read
off the message as it came.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Scatiute Wireless Station.&mdash;Big dirigible seen
drifting east. Making signals of distress. Do
you know anything about her?”</p></blockquote>

<p>“Great guns!” puffed the captain. “Just as I
thought, she’s drifting out to sea sure enough.
Raise ’em at Scatiute, Hutchings. Ask ’em what
appears to be the matter with her.”</p>

<p>Hutchings applied himself to his key and in
a few minutes he had this answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>“Impossible to tell what is trouble. Appears
to be in gas bag but not sure. Should send help,
if possible.”</p>

<p>“That settles it!” cried Jack, “we’ll go after
her.”</p>

<p>“I ought to say no, but somehow, all I can say
is ‘Go ahead, my boys, and good luck’!” cried the
captain, clasping the boy’s hand.</p>

<p>No time was to be lost and the boys hastened
from the wireless office to where the Electric
Monarch stood surrounded by an admiring
crowd. There was great excitement as the boys
were seen climbing on board. People came running
from all parts of the grounds for, early as
the hour was, there was still quite a small crowd
scattered about inspecting the various air craft.</p>

<p>“What is it?” “Are they going to make a
flight?”</p>

<p>These and a hundred other questions were
bandied about from mouth to mouth. The boys
worked like beavers and it was evident even to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
the dullest-witted onlooker that there was something
unusual in the wind.</p>

<p>In ten minutes everything was ready. At the
last moment Jack had requested a coil of good
strong rope, which was loaned to him by one of
the dirigible men. When this had been taken on
board all was ready for the start. The boy took
his place in the pilot house and the others assumed
their stations. Ned oiled up the motor
and Tom saw that the stern propeller bearings
were in good working order.</p>

<p>“Good-bye and good luck!” hailed the captain
as Jack’s hand sought the starting switch.</p>

<p>At that moment, and just as the first impulses
of the motor throbbed through the frame of the
Electric Monarch, there was a sudden motion in
the crowd.</p>

<p>“Lemme through!” bawled a voice, which Ned
Nevins recognized with a start. It was Hank
Nevins, his ne’er-do-well cousin. Close at Hank’s
heels came Miles Sharkey. The two elbowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
their way through the crowd, followed by a thickset
man who bore the unmistakable stamp of an
officer of the law. Miles Sharkey was waving a
paper above his head.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” he bawled at the top of his voice,
“don’t let that craft go up!”</p>

<p>“Why not?” yelled Captain Sprowl, his face
purple.</p>

<p>“This officer will explain,” cried Hank, “we got
a conjunction.”</p>

<p>“Injunction,” he means, explained Miles, the
law sharp, with a grin. “We’ve got an injunction
prohibiting those boys from handling the
Electric Monarch.”</p>

<p>The captain stood aghast. The boys on the
Electric Monarch could not catch just what was
going on but they knew that the controversy concerned
them.</p>

<p>“On what grounds did you obtain this injunction?”
demanded the captain, controlling himself
with difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>“On the grounds that this craft belongs to
Hank Nevins here. It was built from plans left
to him by his father,” cried Miles.</p>

<p>“How do you know they were left to him?”</p>

<p>“We have found a will. It was only discovered
a few days ago after that young thief on
board the Monarch there had appropriated the
plans himself.”</p>

<p>“Is this right, officer?” demanded the confused
captain in a bewildered way. “I ain’t much of a
hand at the law myself.”</p>

<p>“It’s right, all right,” said the officer stolidly.
“They’ve got an injunction restraining this craft
from flying,&mdash;that’s the law.”</p>

<p>“He! he! he!” chuckled Hank. “This is the
time I’ve fixed my smart young cousin. There
was a will, after all.”</p>

<p>Jack was becoming impatient. From the pilot
house he shouted down to the captain:</p>

<p>“Shall we go ahead?”</p>

<p>The captain was about to reply in the negative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>,
explaining that the law must be complied with,
when Hank shoved rudely against the old seaman,
almost pushing him over.</p>

<p>“Lemme by,” he snarled. “I’ll attend to this!”</p>

<p>It was then that the vials of the captain’s wrath
boiled over.</p>

<p>“You young limb!” he bellowed. “D’ye think
I’ll sacrifice human life for a thousand injunctions?
Go ahead, boys!”</p>

<p>There was a roar and shout, and the Electric
Monarch jumped forward. The crowd scattered
right and left. Hank and Miles leaped after the
craft. The wind from the propellers caught the
former and hurled him to the ground.</p>

<p>“Stop ’em!” bellowed Miles, and then he turned
furiously on the officer. “Why don’t you stop
’em, you&mdash;you muttonhead?”</p>

<p>“Keep a civil tongue in you, young feller,”
warned the officer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> “There’s no power on earth’ll
stop ’em now. That injunction will have to wait.”</p>

<p>A mighty cheer from the crowd drowned
Miles’s furious reply.</p>

<p>The Electric Monarch had taken the air in a
graceful, sweeping slant. The powerful craft
was off on an errand of life or death.</p>

<small>A DARING RESCUE.</small></h2>


<p>Entirely unconscious of the fact that they were
law breakers, the boys’ hearts beat high with the
love of adventure as the Electric Monarch soared
above Portstown, saluted by scores of whistles,
and dashed off south in the direction of Scatiute.</p>

<p>The lads had been in many surprising adventures,
but they had never encountered such a
crisis as the present one. Somewhere out above
the ocean, the glimmer of which they could catch
to the eastward, was drifting a crippled dirigible
with three men on board. It was their task to
find that craft and rescue the men.</p>

<p>The captain had confided to Jack the names of
the men, and so, when Ned put the question to
him a short time after the start he was able to
inform him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>“The owner of the Sky Eagle is Mr. Holmes
Morse of New York,” he said; “with him, acting
as engineer, is a man named Tyler and the operator
is named Jennings.”</p>

<p>“Tyler!” exclaimed Ned, as if the name struck
a key in his memory. “It is odd, but that was the
name of one of my uncle’s closest friends. He
was an engineer who took up aërial work. I
wonder if it could be the same.”</p>

<p>“It might be. But Tyler is a very common
name.”</p>

<p>“To be sure, but the coincidence in the names
and occupations struck me.”</p>

<p>“By the way, talking of that, didn’t I hear you
say that in the crowd that gathered about us before
we started, you saw your rascally cousin,
Hank?”</p>

<p>“I did,” rejoined Ned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span> “but what in the world
he could have been doing here I can’t imagine.
Miles Sharkey was with him, too. I’ll bet they
were up to some mischief.”</p>

<p>“Connected with the Electric Monarch?”</p>

<p>“Naturally; what else would they have been
doing in Portstown.”</p>

<p>“But how could they have known that we were
there?”</p>

<p>“I suppose they read that advertisement of the
captain’s. He said he had it put in every paper of
any prominence.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s it. It was plain enough that
they were kicking up some sort of a rumpus just
as we were leaving.”</p>

<p>“So it looked to me. They were waving some
sort of a paper.”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t our funeral. The captain gave
us the word to go, and that’s all we’ve got to do
with it. I’d give a good deal to know, though,
just what they were trying to do.”</p>

<p>Perhaps it was just as well for Ned that he did
not know. The knowledge that the Electric Monarch
was not his any longer but had been legally
left to his cousin would have made him absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
miserable, for his whole being was wrapped up
in the craft.</p>

<p>“Keep a bright lookout for the lighthouse at
Scatiute, Ned&mdash;we ought to be sighting it at almost
any moment now.”</p>

<p>“I’m watching for it,” rejoined Ned, as he went
back to the motor platform to oil the bearings.</p>

<p>Not more than ten minutes later Jack’s sharp
eyes caught sight of a white finger pointing upward
to the sky at the extremity of a rocky point.
He guessed that this must be Scatiute. The
Electric Monarch had been skirting the coast, but
as they swung by the lighthouse, Jack headed her
straight out to sea.</p>

<p>Then began a period of tension that was to endure
for several hours. Below them lay the glittering
sea, calm and heaving gently, and flashing
in the bright sunlight. But from even that
height, with the extended horizon the elevation
gave them, none of the watchers on the Electric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
Monarch could detect any sign of the craft they
had come in search of.</p>

<p>As hour after hour went by without a sign of
her, Jack’s heart began to sink. What if they
were too late&mdash;if the Sky Eagle had sunk, carrying
with her, into the depths of the sea, her unfortunate
crew?</p>

<p>The thought was a serious one, and Jack, with
a sober, thoughtful face speeded up the Electric
Monarch a trifle so as to lose no time in case the
Sky Eagle was yet above the surface of the sea.</p>

<p>There was but little wind, but what there was,
was off shore, so that the Sky Eagle must have
drifted seaward very rapidly. Her occupants
would naturally have kept as much gas as possible
in the bag in order to keep her above the
waves. In such a case the drift would have been
even more rapid than if the bag had been partially
deflated.</p>

<p>Suddenly Joyce’s deep bass voice came booming
from the forward lookout, from which posi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>tion
he had been scanning the sea with binoculars.</p>

<p>“There’s something dead ahead of us!”</p>

<p>Instantly the Electric Monarch fairly vibrated
excitement. Ned hastened into the pilot house to
Jack’s side. He found the young skipper with the
binoculars at his eyes.</p>

<p>“Can you make out what it is?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’m not quite certain, yet. Whatever it is, it
appears to be almost floating on the sea. It may
be a small craft, and the floating effect may be
caused by a refraction of the light or it may be&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The Sky Eagle!” Ned finished for him.</p>

<p>The next moment Joyce’s voice came thrilling
through the speaking tube from the foreward
lookout.</p>

<p>“It’s a balloon! She’s almost in the sea!”</p>

<p>Simultaneously Jack had descried what the distant
object was. “The balloon” as Joyce called it
was, without doubt, the Sky Eagle. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
dirigible was perilously near to the water. In
fact she appeared to be almost touching the surface.
Would they be in time?</p>

<p>“Hold tight!” warned Jack. “I’m going to let
her out every notch.”</p>

<p>With a deep whirring roar the propellers began
to beat the air faster. As they churned the
atmosphere at fifteen hundred revolutions a minute,
the Electric Monarch responded nobly to the
powerful impulse. She was making faster speed
than ever before. The hand of the indicator
crept up and up.</p>

<p>“Fifty&mdash;fifty-five&mdash;sixty&mdash;sixty-five&mdash;seventy!”</p>

<p>“Seventy miles an hour!” gasped Ned. “Will
she hold together?”</p>

<p>“She’s got to,” said Jack grimly, as he grasped
the spokes of his wheel more firmly. At that
speed the “pull” of the rudder was terrific. He
only hoped that it would not be dragged out of
its fastenings.</p>

<p>The Electric Monarch’s frame creaked and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
complained, and every brace and wire in her
structure hummed a separate song as they cut
through the air. Luckily, the wind was with
them, or the craft, strong as she was, might not
have endured the cruel strain.</p>

<p>Every second brought them closer to the
stranded and disabled dirigible. They could see
the unfortunate craft quite plainly now. She
lay with a shriveled and collapsed gas bag almost
on the surface of the waves. A jagged rent in
one side showed what had brought her down into
such perilous proximity to the waves.</p>

<p>From time to time, so close was she to the
water, a larger wave than usual would lap up
against the under part of the craft’s structure,
and drench the men marooned on board the sinking
dirigible.</p>

<p>“Only just in time!” exclaimed Jack, as he manipulated
his descending levers, cut down the
power and landed in the water not twenty yards
from the sinking Sky Eagle, with skill that resulted
in hardly a splash.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a><br />

<small>A STRANGE MEETING.</small></h2>


<p>The work of rescue was not easily accomplished.
The boys did not dare attach a rope to
the dirigible as there was a chance that the craft
would sink at any moment. But by good luck the
occupants of the craft had on board a plank
which they used in climbing in and out of the airship’s
substructure.</p>

<p>This came in useful now. Under Jack’s direction
the plank was extended between the two
craft and one by one the luckless voyagers of the
Sky Eagle were transferred to the Electric Monarch.
Great was their wonderment at the surprising
craft that had effected their rescue when
they had given up all hope.</p>

<p>Greater still was their gratitude to the brave
lads who, at the risk of their lives, had followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
the ocean air-lanes in search of the missing dirigible.</p>

<p>“We owe our lives to you, lads. I do not know
how I can ever thank you,” declared Mr. Morse,
the owner of the craft.</p>

<p>In the meantime Henry Tyler, the machinist
and engineer of the Sky Eagle, had been staring
at Ned Nevins with an amazement that was akin
to unbelief.</p>

<p>“Surely you are Ned, Jeptha Nevins’s
nephew?” he exclaimed at length.</p>

<p>“Yes, and you are Henry Tyler, his dearest
friend!” replied Ned, as the two warmly shook
hands.</p>

<p>“So it was the same Tyler after all,” smiled
Jack, after they had all been introduced.</p>

<p>“It certainly is a small world,” declared Mr.
Morse smilingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> “So this is the lad whose uncle
designed this wonderful craft and left him the
plans of it! My boy, you have a legacy worth
more than a great deal of money.”</p>

<p>“<em>We</em> think so at any rate,” said Ned, smiling at
his chums.</p>

<p>“But where in the world have you been hiding
yourself?” asked Henry Tyler of Ned Nevins as
they prepared to get under way, having transferred
a few instruments, and so forth, from the
Sky Eagle.</p>

<p>“Why, have you been looking for me?” asked
Ned in some surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, for weeks. But I could obtain no clew
to your whereabouts. No one in Millville appeared
to know what had become of you.”</p>

<p>“I have been at Nestorville with my two good
friends, Jack Chadwick and Tom Jesson. Had it
not been for them the Electric Monarch would
never have been built,” said Ned, gratefully.</p>

<p>“I wanted to deliver to you a package left in
my care by your uncle not long before he died,”
said Tyler.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> “He charged me to give it to you
after his death, which, it seemed, he felt was
not far off. I have kept it with me always, hoping
some time to meet you and now I can at last
deliver it into the hands of its rightful owner.”</p>

<p>Ned, with some wonderment, took from Tyler’s
hands a long yellow envelope. He had no time to
open it just then, for Jack ordered all hands to
their posts for the return voyage. They had
hardly risen into the air before the Sky Eagle
was seen to settle down upon the water with a
sliding motion.</p>

<p>Suddenly she gave a swoop downward and the
next instant the sea had hidden her from view.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, old ship,” said Mr. Morse, with
some emotion, “may you rest well.”</p>

<p>Such was the requiem of the Sky Eagle. As
to the manner in which she had become disabled,
Mr. Morse explained to the boys that the heat of
the sun had burst the bag and that following that
disaster the engines had broken down. Helpless,
and with the gas leaking from the momentarily
enlarging rent, the Sky Eagle drifted rapidly out
to sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>Death stared the voyagers in the face, and they
had prepared to meet their fate as calmly as possible
when, upon the horizon, they descried, winging
her way toward them, the form of the Electric
Monarch. Mr. Morse declared that words
could not describe their emotions as they sighted
the outlines of the rescue ship.</p>

<p>The run back to the shore was made without
incident. The boys flew straight for the Fair
Grounds, where they were received with what
resembled an ovation. Word of their gallant
voyage of rescue had leaked out, and the town
went wild over them. They surged about the
Electric Monarch as she landed and fairly
mobbed the boys. Cheers rang out deafeningly,
and the band played, at the direction of Captain
Sprowl, “Hail to the Chief,” that being the most
appropriate tune the old captain could think of.</p>

<p>It was in the midst of all this excitement that
a stoutly built, red-faced man came elbowing
through the crowd that surrounded the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
and made his way to where they stood in a blushing,
embarrassed group.</p>

<p>“Which of you is Ned Nevins?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Right here,” said Ned, stepping forward.
“What do you want?”</p>

<p>“You must come with me,” was the response.</p>

<p>“But why? I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Young man, you are under arrest,” and the
red-faced man threw back his coat and disclosed
a star.</p>

<p>“Under arrest!” echoed Ned. “What for?”</p>

<p>“For disobeying an injunction of the court.
Come with me.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a><br />

<small>NED COMES INTO HIS OWN.</small></h2>


<p>Ned’s dismay may be imagined. He was
taken straight to the magistrate’s courtroom
where the charge against him was heard. In the
meantime, Captain Sprowl had engaged a lawyer
for him, and the courtroom was thronged when
Ned’s case was called. His lawyer cautioned Ned
to let him do all the talking and the boy, feeling
very nervous and ill at ease before the battery
of eyes aimed in his direction, sat silent while the
attorney explained to the court the circumstances
of the case.</p>

<p>The magistrate heard him out and agreed with
him that it seemed a hardship that the boy should
be held for disobeying an injunction in order to
save lives, but he declared that he had no powers
in the matter, as the injunction had been issued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
by the higher court. It would be for that court
to decide in the matter, and that therefore he
had no choice but to hold Ned in bonds of $2,000
for contempt of court. Poor Ned turned pale
when he heard this, but the lawyer hastily assured
him that it meant nothing, and was merely a formality.</p>

<p>“I’ve got the money right here!” bellowed Captain
Sprowl from the rear of the courtroom,
flourishing a bundle of bills like a madman.</p>

<p>“Order in the court!” shouted the bailiffs frantically,
for the captain’s actions had caused a
storm of applause.</p>

<p>The next day Ned’s case came up before the
court which had issued the injunction. Hank and
Miles Sharkey, with greedy, triumphant faces, sat
in front seats to witness the lad’s discomfiture.
Ned, seeing their eyes fixed on him, held himself
together bravely. In his eyes there was an almost
excited light. However, he appeared to be awaiting
some sort of a climax.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>As for the other boys, they were openly shaking
hands in the back of the courtroom and slapping
each other on the back. Captain Sprowl
bore a wide grin and Ned’s lawyer looked well
pleased.</p>

<p>Hank and Miles noted these signs of satisfaction,
and they began to grow uneasy. This uneasiness
increased to positive alarm when Ned’s
lawyer, instead of opening the proceeding in the
usual way, asked to see a copy of the will, on the
strength of which the injunction had been
granted.</p>

<p>“Um-er-er, this is an unusual proceeding, may
it please your honor,” stammered Miles, who, not
anticipating anything but plain sailing, had decided
to save a lawyer’s fee and act as his own
attorney.</p>

<p>But the court overruled him and Miles was
compelled to produce what purported to be the
last will and testament of Jeptha Nevins, deceased,
in which he left,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span> “all papers, plans, prints
and designs of my inventions whatsoever to my
beloved son, Henry Nevins.”</p>

<p>“If your honor pleases, may I examine that
will?” asked Ned’s lawyer.</p>

<p>The court bowed its assent. Miles, with trembling
hands, passed the paper over to the attorney.
Hank rose to his feet and tried to tip-toe
out, but he was stopped by a bailiff who told him
that he had orders not to let witnesses in the case
out of the courtroom. Miserable and dejected,
Hank slipped back into his seat. His face was
pasty white and his knees shook. But he did not
look a whit more wretched and abject than Miles
Sharkey, who nervously fingered his face and
drummed on the table alternately, while Ned’s
lawyer scanned the will Miles had handed him.</p>

<p>The lawyer finally ceased his examination of
the paper, and then clearing his throat solemnly,
he said:</p>

<p>“Acting for the defendant in this case I pronounce
this will a forgery.” There was a buzz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
of excitement through the courtroom. Miles
tried to speak, but words would not come from
his dry lips. Hank looked ghastly and sank back
in his seat in a wilted, crumpled heap.</p>

<p>“And furthermore,” relentlessly proceeded the
attorney, “we have a genuine will antedating this
spurious one. If your honor will give me permission
I will produce it.”</p>

<p>Forthwith he placed in evidence the will of
Jeptha Nevins by which he left specifically to Ned
the plans of the Electric Monarch and the proceeds
of his other inventions. (The will had been
contained in the envelope which Henry Tyler had
handed to Ned on board the Electric Monarch
the day before.)</p>

<p>“We can prove that this is the genuine signature
of Jeptha Nevins and that the other is a base
forgery,” continued the attorney,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span> “and I would
ask your honor to make out a commitment for
Miles Sharkey on the charge of forgery in the
first degree and to hold Henry Nevins on a charge
of aiding and abetting the same.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t aid nor abet nothin’,” shrieked out
Hank despairingly, “it was Miles done it all, your
honor.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, you fool,” hissed Miles, but it was
too late. Hank had let the cat out of the bag with
a vengeance. The commitments were made out
and in due course of time both Miles and Hank
paid the penalty of their rascality in the form of
prison sentences. Hank, however, received a
light punishment, as it was clear that Miles Sharkey,
who had hoped to reap big profits from the
Mellville concern, had been the ring leader in the
plot.</p>

<p>We have no space here to relate how the Electric
Monarch acquitted herself at the big aëro
carnival. But suffice it to say that she won every
event for which she was entered, and at the conclusion
of the meet Ned was approached by the
representative of an aëro-craft manufacturing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
concern with an offer to build ships of the Electric
Monarch type, paying him a handsome bonus
and a royalty.</p>

<p>On their return to High Towers, the boys
found Prof. Chadwick very much better, almost
in his usual health, in fact, although Dr. Goodenough
laughingly said that he was “booked for
a long vacation.”</p>

<p>One day, not long after their return to their
home, which, by the way, was now also Ned Nevins’,
the gentleman who had tried to make negotiations
with Ned at the carnival paid a visit to
High Towers to try to close a deal with the young
inventor.</p>

<p>Professor Chadwick and Dr. Goodenough were
called into consultation, and after a long conference,
it was decided that it would be to Ned’s
advantage to accept the firm’s offer, more especially
as he would, under their terms, retain an
interest in the Electric Monarch type of hydroaeroplane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>When these arrangements had been concluded,
Professor Chadwick reached into a drawer of his
desk, at which he was seated, in order to produce
blotting paper to sign the contracts. But as he
opened the drawer he suddenly paused, turned
deathly pale, and pressed his hand to his forehead.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, are you ill?” cried the
doctor in a concerned voice.</p>

<p>The boys, full of anxiety and alarm, repeated
the question. But Professor Chadwick waved
them aside.</p>

<p>“No, not ill,” he exclaimed in a strange voice.
“Wait&mdash;wait! It is coming back to me now!”</p>

<p>He pressed a spring in his desk, and a secret
drawer flew open. As it did so, they all uttered a
shout of astonishment.</p>

<p>It contained the long-missing plans!</p>

<p>The mystery was soon explained. The Professor’s
memory had come back to him with a
rush when he opened the drawer for the blotting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
paper. On the day of the trial trip of the Electric
Monarch, it will be recalled, he had been left
behind. After the boys’ departure, (as it came
back to him, he had begun to feel uneasy about
the plans, secure though they seemed to be in the
safe.)</p>

<p>He decided to find a better hiding place than
the safe even, for them, and with that object in
view arose from the lounge and opened the receptacle.
Taking out the papers, he placed them in
the secret drawer of the desk. Hardly had he
done so, however, when an attack of vertigo
seized him and he fell unconscious. Now that his
memory had come back suddenly, as he seated
himself once more at the desk, all became clear.</p>

<p>And so the mystery of the vanished plans was
cleared up with satisfaction to all of them. After
all, they had wrongfully suspected Hank and his
allies, and they were glad to learn that their suspicions
had been unfounded.</p>

<p>There is little more to tell. Heiny Dill finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
evolved a burglar trap out of his invention, but
he makes more money working for the Boy Inventors
at High Towers than he does out of his
numerous eccentric contrivances. Sam Hinkley
returned to Nestorville not long after his invasion
of New York, and after he had begged for
forgiveness, his father finally gave him the post
of night clerk in the hotel, which he fills admirably.
Of the fate of Hank and Miles we are already
informed.</p>

<p>And so, with Ned Nevins prosperous and
happy, and the Boy Inventors broadened and improved
by their experiences with the Electric
Monarch, we will, for the present, leave them
with the best of wishes for their future undertakings.
Knowing them to be always on the alert
for the latest developments in scientific progress,
we are not greatly surprised to learn that their
next experimental experiences will be described
in a volume entitled, “The Boy Inventors’ Radio
Telephone.”</p>

<p>The launching of this Twentieth Century series marks
the inauguration of a new era in boys’ books&mdash;the
“wonders of modern science” epoch. Frank and Harry
Chester, the Boy Aviators, are the heroes of this exciting,
red-blooded tale of adventure by air and land in
the turbulent Central American republic. The two
brothers with their $10,000 prize aeroplane, the Golden
Eagle, rescue a chum from death in the clutches of the
Nicaraguans, discover a lost treasure valley of the ancient
Toltec race, and in so doing almost lose their own
lives in the Abyss of the White Serpents, and have many
other exciting experiences, including being blown far
out to sea in their air-skimmer in a tropical storm. It
would be unfair to divulge the part that wireless plays
in rescuing them from their predicament. In a brand
new field of fiction for boys the Chester brothers and
their aeroplane seem destined to fill a top-notch place.
These books are technically correct, wholesomely thrilling
and geared up to third speed.</p>

<p class="center large">The Boy Aviators on Secret Service</p>

<p class="center">Or, Working With Wireless</p>

<p>In this live-wire narrative of peril and adventure,
laid in the Everglades of Florida, the spunky Chester
Boys and their interesting chums, including Ben Stubbs,
the maroon, encounter exciting experiences on Uncle
Sam’s service in a novel field. One must read this
vivid, enthralling story of incident, hardship and pluck
to get an idea of the almost limitless possibilities of
the two greatest inventions of modern times&mdash;the aeroplane
and wireless telegraphy. While gripping and
holding the reader’s breathless attention from the opening
words to the finish, this swift-moving story is at
the same time instructive and uplifting. As those
readers who have already made friends with Frank and
Harry Chester and their “bunch” know, there are few
difficulties, no matter how insurmountable they may
seem at first blush, that these up-to-date gritty youths
cannot overcome with flying colors. A clean-cut, real
boys’ book of high voltage.</p>

<p class="center large">The Boy Aviators in Africa</p>

<p class="center">Or, An Aerial Ivory Trail</p>

<p>In this absorbing book we meet, on a Continent made
famous by the American explorer Stanley, and ex-President
Roosevelt, our old friends, the Chester Boys and
their stalwart chums. In Africa&mdash;the Dark Continent&mdash;the
author follows in exciting detail his young heroes,
their voyage in the first aeroplane to fly above the mysterious
forests and unexplored ranges of the mystic land.
In this book, too, for the first time, we entertain Luther
Barr, the old New York millionaire, who proved later
such an implacable enemy of the boys. The story of his
defeated schemes, of the astonishing things the boys discovered
in the Mountains of the Moon, of the pathetic
fate of George Desmond, the emulator of Stanley, the
adventure of the Flying Men and the discovery of the
Arabian Ivory cache,&mdash;this is not the place to speak. It
would be spoiling the zest of an exciting tale to reveal
the outcome of all these episodes here. It may be said,
however, without “giving away” any of the thrilling
chapters of this narrative, that Captain Wilbur Lawton,
the author, is in it in his best vein, and from his personal
experiences in Africa has been able to supply a striking
background for the adventures of his young heroes. As
one newspaper says of this book: “Here is adventure in
good measure, pressed down and running over.”</p>

for all that. A garrulous old sailor, who holds the key
to the mystery of the Golden Galleon, plays a large
part in the development of the plot of this fascinating
narrative of treasure hunting in the region of the Gulf
Stream and the Sargasso Sea. An aeroplane fitted with efficient
pontoons&mdash;enabling her to skim the water successfully&mdash;has
long been a dream of aviators. The Chester
Boys seem to have solved the problem. The Sargasso,
that strange drifting ocean within an ocean, holding ships
of a dozen nations and a score of ages, in its relentless
grip, has been the subject of many books of adventure
and mystery, but in none has the secret of the ever
shifting mass of treacherous currents been penetrated as
it has in the BOY AVIATORS TREASURE QUEST.
Luther Barr, whom it seemed the boys had shaken off,
is still on their trail, in this absorbing book and with a
dirigible balloon, essays to beat them out in their search
for the Golden Galleon. Every boy, every man&mdash;and
woman and girl&mdash;who has ever felt the stirring summons
of adventure in their souls, had better get hold of this
book. Once obtained, it will be read and re-read till
it falls to rags.</p>

<p class="center large">The Boy Aviators in Record Flight</p>

<p class="center">Or, The Rival Aeroplane</p>

<p>The Chester Boys in new field of endeavor&mdash;an attempt
to capture a newspaper prize for a trans-continental flight.
By the time these lines are read, exactly such an offer
will have been spread broadcast by one of the foremost
newspapers of the country. In the Golden Eagle, the
boys, accompanied by a trail-blazing party in an automobile,
make the dash. But they are not alone in their
aspirations. Their rivals for the rich prize at stake try
in every way that they can to circumvent the lads and
gain the valuable trophy and monetary award. In this
they stop short at nothing, and it takes all the wits and
resources of the Boy Aviators to defeat their devices.
Among the adventures encountered in their cross-country
flight, the boys fall in with a band of rollicking cow-boys&mdash;who
momentarily threaten serious trouble&mdash;are attacked
by Indians, strike the most remarkable town of the
desert&mdash;the “dry” town of “Gow Wells,” encounter a
sandstorm which blows them into strange lands far to the
south of their course, and meet with several amusing
mishaps beside. A thoroughly readable book. The sort
to take out behind the barn on the sunny side of the haystack,
and, with a pocketful of juicy apples and your heels
kicking the air, pass happy hours with Captain Lawton’s
young heroes.</p>

<div class="box">

<p class="center large">The Boy Aviators Polar Dash</p>

<p class="center">Or, Facing Death in the Antarctic</p>

<p>If you were to hear that two boys, accompanying a South
Polar expedition in charge of the aeronautic department,
were to penetrate the Antarctic regions&mdash;hitherto only
attained by a few daring explorers&mdash;you would feel interested,
wouldn’t you? Well, in Captain Lawton’s latest
book, concerning his Boy Aviators, you can not only read
absorbing adventure in the regions south of the eightieth
parallel, but absorb much useful information as well.
Captain Lawton introduces&mdash;besides the original characters
of the heroes&mdash;a new creation in the person of Professor
Simeon Sandburr, a patient seeker for polar insects.
The professor’s adventures in his quest are the
cause of much merriment, and lead once or twice to
serious predicaments. In a volume so packed with incident
and peril from cover to cover&mdash;relieved with laughable
mishaps to the professor&mdash;it is difficult to single out any
one feature; still, a recent reader of it wrote the publishers
an enthusiastic letter the other day, saying: “The
episodes above the Great Barrier are thrilling, the attack
of the condors in Patagonia made me hold my breath,
the&mdash;but what’s the use? The Polar Dash, to my mind,
is an even more entrancing book than Captain Lawton’s
previous efforts, and that’s saying a good deal. The aviation
features and their technical correctness are by no
means the least attractive features of this up-to-date
creditable volume.”</p>

<p>BEN STONE AT OAKDALE.</p>

<p class="small">Under peculiarly trying circumstances
Ben Stone wins his way at
Oakdale Academy, and at the
same time enlists our sympathy,
interest and respect. Through the
enmity of Bern Hayden, the loyalty
of Roger Eliot and the clever work
of the “Sleuth,” Ben is falsely accused,
championed and vindicated.</p>


<p>BOYS OF OAKDALE ACADEMY.</p>

<p class="small">“One thing I will claim, and that
is that all Grants fight open and
square and there never was a sneak among them.” It was
Rodney Grant, of Texas, who made the claim to his friend,
Ben Stone, and this story shows how he proved the truth
of this statement in the face of apparent evidence to the
contrary.</p>


<p>RIVAL PITCHERS OF OAKDALE.</p>

<p class="small">Baseball is the main theme of this interesting narrative,
and that means not only clear and clever descriptions of
thrilling games, but an intimate acquaintance with the
members of the teams who played them. The Oakdale
Boys were ambitious and loyal, and some were even disgruntled
and jealous, but earnest, persistent work won out.</p>


<p>OAKDALE BOYS IN CAMP.</p>

<p class="small">The typical vacation is the one that means much freedom,
little restriction, and immediate contact with “all outdoors.”
These conditions prevailed in the summer camp of
the Oakdale Boys and made it a scene of lively interest.</p>


<p>THE GREAT OAKDALE MYSTERY.</p>

<p class="small">The “Sleuth” scents a mystery! He “follows his nose.”
The plot thickens! He makes deductions. There are
surprises for the reader&mdash;and for the “Sleuth,” as well.</p>


<p>NEW BOYS AT OAKDALE.</p>

<p class="small">A new element creeps into Oakdale with another year’s
registration of students. The old and the new standards
of conduct in and out of school meet, battle, and cause
sweeping changes in the lives of several of the boys.</p>

<p>THE BOY INVENTORS’ WIRELESS TELEGRAPH.</p>

<p class="small">Blest with natural curiosity,&mdash;sometimes
called the instinct of investigation,&mdash;favored
with golden
opportunity, and gifted with creative
ability, the Boy Inventors
meet emergencies and contrive
mechanical wonders that interest
and convince the reader because
they always “work” when put to
the test.</p>


<p>THE BOY INVENTORS’ VANISHING GUN.</p>

<p class="small">A thought, a belief, an experiment; discouragement,
hope, effort and final success&mdash;this is the history of many
an invention; a history in which excitement, competition,
danger, despair and persistence figure. This merely suggests
the circumstances which draw the daring Boy Inventors
into strange experiences and startling adventures,
and which demonstrate the practical use of their vanishing
gun.</p>


<p>THE BOY INVENTORS’ DIVING TORPEDO BOAT.</p>

<p class="small">As in the previous stories of the Boy Inventors, new
and interesting triumphs of mechanism are produced
which become immediately valuable, and the stage for
their proving and testing is again the water. On the
surface and below it, the boys have jolly, contagious fun,
and the story of their serious, purposeful inventions
challenge the reader’s deepest attention.</p>

the problem that Jack Merrill and

<p>THE BORDER BOYS ACROSS THE FRONTIER.</p>

<p class="small">Read of the Haunted Mesa and its

feel that not even the ancient splendors of the Old World

Border of the New.</p>


<p>THE BORDER BOYS WITH THE MEXICAN RANGERS.</p>

<p class="small">As every day is making history&mdash;faster, it is said, than

deals with lively times on the Mexican border.</p>


<p>THE BORDER BOYS WITH THE TEXAS RANGERS.</p>

<p class="small">The Border Boys have already had much excitement
and adventure in their lives, but all this has served to
prepare them for the experiences related in this volume.
They are stronger, braver and more resourceful than ever,
and the exigencies of their life in connection with the

<p>THE BUNGALOW BOYS.</p>

<p class="small">How the Bungalow Boys received
their title and how they retained the
right to it in spite of much opposition
makes a lively narrative for lively boys.</p>


<p>THE BUNGALOW BOYS MAROONED IN THE TROPICS.</p>

<p class="small">A real treasure hunt of the most
thrilling kind, with a sunken Spanish
galleon as its object, makes a
subject of intense interest at any
time, but add to that a band of desperate men, a dark plot
and a devil fish, and you have the combination that brings
strange adventures into the lives of the Bungalow Boys.</p>


<p>THE BUNGALOW BOYS IN THE GREAT NORTH WEST.</p>

<p class="small">The clever assistance of a young detective saves the boys
from the clutches of Chinese smugglers, of whose nefarious
trade they know too much. How the Professor’s invention relieves
a critical situation is also an exciting incident of this book.</p>


<p>THE BUNGALOW BOYS ON THE GREAT LAKES.</p>

<p class="small">The Bungalow Boys start out for a quiet cruise on the
Great Lakes and a visit to an island. A storm and a band

submarine adds zest and adventure to it.</p>

<p class="small">Especially interesting and timely
is this book which introduces the

and to the intimate life and surprising
adventures of Uncle Sam’s sailors.</p>


<p>THE DREADNOUGHT BOYS ABOARD A DESTROYER.</p>

<p class="small">In this story real dangers threaten
and the boys’ patriotism is tested in
a peculiar international tangle. The scene is laid on the
South American coast.</p>


<p>THE DREADNOUGHT BOYS ON A SUBMARINE.</p>

<p class="small">To the inventive genius&mdash;trade-school boy or mechanic&mdash;this
story has special charm, perhaps, but to every reader its
mystery and clever action are fascinating.</p>


<p>THE DREADNOUGHT BOYS ON AERO SERVICE.</p>

in the name of the Government; nor are they always able
to fly beyond the reach of their old “enemies,” who are also

<p class="small">This is an absorbing story of the

“stunts,” and yet everything
happens “in the nick of time.”</p>


<p>THE MOTOR RANGERS THROUGH THE SIERRAS.</p>

<p class="small">Enemies in ambush, the peril of

with a typical Western mountaineer for spice.</p>


<p class="hang">THE MOTOR RANGERS ON BLUE WATER; <small>or,

of this well-spun yarn of the sea.</p>


<p>THE MOTOR RANGERS’ CLOUD CRUISER.</p>

<p class="small">From the “Nomad” to the “Discoverer,” from the sea to
the sky, the scene changes in which the Motor Rangers figure.
They have experiences “that never were on land or sea,”
in heat and cold and storm, over mountain peak and lost
city, with savages and reptiles; their ship of the air is attacked
by huge birds of the air; they survive explosion and
earthquake; they even live to tell the tale!</p>

<p class="small">How Frank’s summer experience

him into a sturdy young athlete
through swimming, boating, and
baseball contests, and a tramp
through the Everglades, is the
subject of this splendid story.</p>


<p>FRANK ARMSTRONG AT QUEENS.</p>

<p class="small">We find among the jolly boys
at Queen’s School, Frank, the student-athlete, Jimmy, the
baseball enthusiast, and Lewis, the unconsciously-funny
youth who furnishes comedy for every page that bears

<p>THE GIRL AVIATORS AND THE PHANTOM AIRSHIP.</p>

<p class="small">Roy Prescott was fortunate in
having a sister so clever and devoted
to him and his interests that
they could share work and play
with mutual pleasure and to mutual
advantage. This proved especially
true in relation to the manufacture
and manipulation of their aeroplane,
and Peggy won well deserved
fame for her skill and good
sense as an aviator. There were
many stumbling-blocks in their terrestrial path, but they
soared above them all to ultimate success.</p>


<p>THE GIRL AVIATORS ON GOLDEN WINGS.</p>

<p class="small">That there is a peculiar fascination about aviation that
wins and holds girl enthusiasts as well as boys is proved
by this tale. On golden wings the girl aviators rose for
many an exciting flight, and met strange and unexpected
experiences.</p>


<p>THE GIRL AVIATORS’ SKY CRUISE.</p>

<p class="small">To most girls a coaching or yachting trip is an adventure.
How much more perilous an adventure a “sky
cruise” might be is suggested by the title and proved by
the story itself.</p>


<p>THE GIRL AVIATORS’ MOTOR BUTTERFLY.</p>

<p class="small">The delicacy of flight suggested by the word “butterfly,”
the mechanical power implied by “motor,” the ability to
control assured in the title “aviator,” all combined with
the personality and enthusiasm of girls themselves, make
this story one for any girl or other reader “to go crazy
over.”</p>

<p>THE MOTOR MAIDS’ SCHOOL DAYS.</p>

<p class="small">Billie Campbell was just the type
of a straightforward, athletic girl
to be successful as a practical
Motor Maid. She took her car, as
she did her class-mates, to her
heart, and many a grand good time
did they have all together. The
road over which she ran her
red machine had many an unexpected
turning,&mdash;now it led her
into peculiar danger; now into contact
with strange travelers; and again into experiences
by fire and water. But, best of all, “The Comet” never
failed its brave girl owner.</p>


<p>THE MOTOR MAIDS BY PALM AND PINE.</p>

<p class="small">Wherever the Motor Maids went there were lively times,
for these were companionable girls who looked upon the
world as a vastly interesting place full of unique adventures&mdash;and
so, of course, they found them.</p>


<p>THE MOTOR MAIDS ACROSS THE CONTINENT.</p>

<p class="small">It is always interesting to travel, and it is wonderfully
entertaining to see old scenes through fresh eyes. It is
that privilege, therefore, that makes it worth while to join
the Motor Maids in their first cross-country run.</p>


<p>THE MOTOR MAIDS BY ROSE, SHAMROCK AND HEATHER.</p>

<p class="small">South and West had the Motor Maids motored, nor
could their education by travel have been more wisely
begun. But now a speaking acquaintance with their own
country enriched their anticipation of an introduction to
the British Isles. How they made their polite American
bow and how they were received on the other side is a
tale of interest and inspiration.</p>

<p>THE MOTOR CYCLE CHUMS AROUND THE WORLD.</p>

<p class="small">Could Jules Verne have dreamed
of encircling the globe with a motor
cycle for emergencies he would have
deemed it an achievement greater
than any he describes in his account
of the amusing travels of Philias
Fogg. This, however, is the purpose
successfully carried out by the Motor
Cycle Chums, and the tale of their
mishaps, hindrances and delays is
one of intense interest, secret amusement,
and incidental information to
the reader.</p>


<p>THE MOTOR CYCLE CHUMS OF THE NORTHWEST PATROL.</p>

<p class="small">The Great Northwest is a section of vast possibilities
and in it the Motor Cycle Chums meet adventures even
more unusual and exciting than many of their experiences
on their tour around the world. There is not a dull page
in this lively narrative of clever boys and their attendant
“Chinee.”</p>


<p>THE MOTOR CYCLE CHUMS IN THE GOLD FIELDS.</p>

<p class="small">The gold fever which ran its rapid course through the
veins of the historic “forty-niners” recurs at certain intervals,
and seizes its victims with almost irresistible
power. The search for gold is so fascinating to the
seekers that hardship, danger and failure are obstacles
that scarcely dampen their ardour. How the Motor Cycle
Chums were caught by the lure of the gold and into what
difficulties and novel experiences they were led, makes a
tale of thrilling interest.</p>

<p>MOLLY BROWN’S FRESHMAN DAYS.</p>

<p class="small">Would you like to admit to your
circle of friends the most charming
of college girls&mdash;the typical college
girl for whom we are always looking
but not always finding; the type
that contains so many delightful
characteristics, yet without unpleasant
perfection in any; the
natural, unaffected, sweet-tempered
girl, loved because she is lovable?
Then seek an introduction to Molly
Brown. You will find the baggage-master, the cook, the
Professor of English Literature, and the College President
in the same company.</p>


<p>MOLLY BROWN’S SOPHOMORE DAYS.</p>

<p class="small">What is more delightful than a re-union of college girls
after the summer vacation? Certainly nothing that precedes
it in their experience&mdash;at least, if all class-mates
are as happy together as the Wellington girls of this
story. Among Molly’s interesting friends of the second
year is a young Japanese girl, who ingratiates her “humbly”
self into everybody’s affections speedily and permanently.</p>


<p>MOLLY BROWN’S JUNIOR DAYS.</p>

<p class="small">Financial stumbling blocks are not the only things that
hinder the ease and increase the strength of college girls.
Their troubles and their triumphs are their own, often
peculiar to their environment. How Wellington students
meet the experiences outside the class-rooms is worth the
doing, the telling and the reading.</p>

<p class="small">A fascinating narrative of the doings of some

with this organization, which has caught on like
wild fire among healthy boys of all ages and in
all parts of the country.</p>

<p class="small">While in no sense a text-book, the volume
deals, amid its exciting adventures, with the
practical side of Scouting. To Rob Blake and
his companions in the Eagle Patrol, surprising,
and sometimes perilous things happen constantly.
But the lads, who are, after all, typical
of most young Americans of their type, are
resourceful enough to overcome every one of
their dangers and difficulties.</p>

<p class="small">How they discover the whereabouts of little
Joe, the “kid” of the patrol, by means of smoke
telegraphy and track his abductors to their disgrace;
how they assist the passengers of a stranded
steamer and foil a plot to harm and perhaps
kill an aged sea-captain, one must read the book
to learn. A swift-moving narrative of convincing
interest and breathless incident.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
